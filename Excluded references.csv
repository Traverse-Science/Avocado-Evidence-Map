Dietary fat and fatty acids in relation to risk of colorectal cancer.,Wan Y; Wu K; Wang L; Yin K; Song M; Giovannucci EL; Willett WC,"PURPOSE: Epidemiologic evidence for specific types and sources of dietary fat and individual fatty acid with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk remains inconclusive. We aimed to comprehensively examine the associations of intakes of specific types (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans) and sources (animal, dairy, and vegetable) of dietary fat and individual fatty acid with CRC risk. DESIGN: We prospectively followed 65,550 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2014) and 45,684 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014). Dietary intake was assessed every 4 years using food frequency questionnaires. Self-reported CRC cases were confirmed through medical record review. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for intakes of dietary fats and fatty acids and CRC risk. RESULTS: During 2,705,560 person-years of follow-up, 2726 incident CRC cases were confirmed. Intake of monounsaturated fat tended to be positively associated with the risk of CRC (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.22; 95% CI 1.01, 1.47; p = 0.06 for trend). This positive association was mainly driven by monounsaturated fatty acids from animal sources (MUFA-As) (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.23; 95% CI 1.02, 1.49; p = 0.02 for trend). The positive association between MUFA-As and CRC was attenuated after adjusting for red and processed meat consumption (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.17; 95% CI 0.95, 1.44; p = 0.13 for trend). We did not find clear associations between other types and sources of dietary fat or individual fatty acid and CRC risk. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of MUFA-As was associated with higher CRC risk. This could be partly explained by confounding due to other components of red and processed meat.",2022,Jun,Eur J Nutr,61,4,1863-1873,,10.1007/s00394-021-02777-9,35048194,#5956,Wan 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Monounsaturated, trans, and saturated Fatty acids and cognitive decline in women.",Naqvi AZ; Harty B; Mukamal KJ; Stoddard AM; Vitolins M; Dunn JE,"OBJECTIVES: To prospectively assess effects of select dietary fats on cognitive decline. DESIGN: Prospective observational; 3-year follow-up. SETTING: Northwestern University. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty-two women aged 60 and older who participated in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study or in the control group of the WHI Diet Modification arm. MEASUREMENTS: Dietary intake from a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered twice (mean 2.7 years apart) before baseline cognitive assessment (mean 2.9 years after second FFQ) was averaged. Testing of memory, vision, executive function, language, and attention was performed twice, 3 years apart. A global Z-score was created for both time points by averaging all Z-scores for each participant, and global cognitive change was defined as the difference between follow-up and baseline Z-scores. RESULTS: Median intake of saturated fat (SFA), trans-fat, (TFA), dietary cholesterol (DC), and monounsaturated fat (MUFA) was 18.53, 3.45, 0.201, and 19.39 g/d, respectively. There were no associations between degree of cognitive decline and intake of SFA (P=.69), TFA (P=.54), or DC (P=.64) after adjusting for baseline cognition, total energy intake, age, education, reading ability, apolipoprotein E ɛ4 allele, body mass index, estrogen and beta-blocker use, and intake of caffeine and other fatty acids. In contrast, MUFA intake was associated with lower cognitive decline in fully adjusted linear regression models, with mean decline (standard error) of 0.21 (0.05) in the lowest and 0.05 (0.05) in the highest quartiles (P=.02). This effect of MUFA intake was primarily in the visual and memory domains (P=.03 for both). CONCLUSION: Greater intake of SFA, TFA, and DC was not associated with cognitive decline, whereas greater MUFA intake was associated with less cognitive decline.",2011,May,J Am Geriatr Soc,59,5,837-43,,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03402.x,21568955,#5965,Naqvi 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Reduction in liver fat by dietary MUFA in type 2 diabetes is helped by enhanced hepatic fat oxidation.,Bozzetto L; Costabile G; Luongo D; Naviglio D; Cicala V; Piantadosi C; Patti L; Cipriano P; Annuzzi G; Rivellese AA,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this work was to investigate hepatic lipid metabolic processes possibly involved in the reduction of liver fat content (LF) observed in patients with type 2 diabetes after an isoenergetic diet enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). METHODS: This is an ancillary analysis of a published study. In a parallel-group design, 30 men and eight women, aged 35-70 years, with type 2 diabetes and whose blood glucose was controlled satisfactorily (HbA(1c) < 7.5% [58 mmol/mol]) by diet or diet plus metformin, were randomised by MINIM software to follow either a high-carbohydrate/high-fibre/low-glycaemic index diet (CHO/fibre diet, n = 20) or a high-MUFA diet (MUFA diet, n = 18) for 8 weeks. The assigned diets were known for the participants and blinded for people doing measurements. Before and after intervention, LF was measured by (1)H-MRS (primary outcome) and indirect indices of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) (serum triacylglycerol palmitic:linoleic acid ratio), stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity (SCD-1) (serum triacylglycerol palmitoleic:palmitic acid ratio) and hepatic β-oxidation of fatty acids (β-hydroxybutyrate plasma concentrations) were measured. RESULTS: LF was reduced by 30% after the MUFA diet, as already reported. Postprandial β-hydroxybutyrate incremental AUC (iAUC) was significantly less suppressed after the MUFA diet (n = 16) (-2504 ± 4488 μmol/l × 360 min vs baseline -9021 ± 6489 μmol/l × 360 min) while it was unchanged after the CHO/fibre diet (n = 17) (-8168 ± 9827 μmol/l × 360 min vs baseline -7206 ± 10,005 μmol/l × 360 min, p = 0.962) (mean ± SD, p = 0.043). In the participants assigned to the MUFA diet, the change in postprandial β-hydroxybutyrate iAUC was inversely associated with the change in LF (r = -0.642, p = 0.010). DNL and SCD-1 indirect indices did not change significantly after either of the dietary interventions. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Postprandial hepatic oxidation of fatty acids is a metabolic process possibly involved in the reduction of LF by a MUFA-rich diet in patients with type 2 diabetes.

A CHO/fibre diet reduces and a MUFA diet increases postprandial lipaemia in type 2 diabetes: no supplementary effects of low-volume physical training.,Bozzetto L; Annuzzi G; Costabile G; Costagliola L; Giorgini M; Alderisio A; Strazzullo A; Patti L; Cipriano P; Mangione A; Vitelli A; Vigorito C; Riccardi G; Rivellese AA,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a supervised physical training added to a healthy diet-rich in either carbohydrate and fibre (CHO/fibre) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-on postprandial dyslipidaemia, an independent cardiovascular risk factor particularly relevant in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Participants were forty-five overweight/obese subjects with T2D, of both genders, in good blood glucose control with diet or diet+metformin, with normal fasting plasma lipids. According to a parallel groups 2 × 2 factorial design, participants were randomized to an 8-week isoenergetic intervention with a CHO/fibre or a MUFA diet, with or without a supervised low-volume aerobic training programme. The main outcome of the study was the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of lipid concentrations in the plasma chylomicron+VLDL lipoprotein fraction, isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation (NCT01025856). Body weight remained stable during the trial in all groups. Physical fitness slightly improved with training (VO2 peak, 16 ± 4 vs. 15 ± 3 ml/kg/min, M ± SD, p < 0.05). Postprandial triglyceride and cholesterol iAUCs in plasma and chylomicron+VLDL fraction decreased after the CHO/fibre diet, but increased after the MUFA diet with a significant effect for diet by two-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). The addition of exercise training to either dietary intervention did not significantly influence postprandial lipid response. A diet rich in carbohydrates and fibre reduced postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins compared with a diet rich in MUFA in patients with T2D. A supervised low-volume physical training did not significantly influence these dietary effects.",2014,,Acta Diabetol,51,3,385-93,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01025856,10.1007/s00592-013-0522-6,24132660,#5978,Bozzetto 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Metabolic responses to high-fat diets rich in MUFA v. PUFA.,Polley KR; Miller MK; Johnson M; Vaughan R; Paton CM; Cooper JA,"Dietary fatty acid (FA) composition may influence metabolism, possibly affecting weight management. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a 5-d diet rich in PUFA v. MUFA. A total of fifteen normal-weight men participated in a randomised cross-over design with two feeding trials (3 d lead-in diet, pre-diet visit, 5-d PUFA- or MUFA-rich diet, post-diet visit). The 5-d diets (50 % fat) were rich in either PUFA (25 % of energy) or MUFA (25 % of energy). At pre- and post-diet visits, subjects consumed breakfast and lunch test meals, rich in the FA for that 5-d diet. Indirect calorimetry was used for 4 h after each meal. There were no treatment differences in fasting metabolism acutely or after the 5-d diet. For acute meal responses before diet, RER was higher for PUFA v. MUFA (0·86 (sem 0·01) v. 0·84 (sem 0·01), P<0·05), whereas diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) was lower for PUFA v. MUFA (18·91 (SEM 1·46) v. 21·46 (SEM 1·34) kJ, P<0·05). After the 5-d diets, the change in RER was different for PUFA v. MUFA (-0·02 (sem 0·01) v. 0·00 (sem 0·01), P<0·05). Similarly, the change in fat oxidation was greater for PUFA v. MUFA (0·18 (sem 0·07) v. 0·04 (sem 0·06) g, P<0·05). In conclusion, acutely, a MUFA-rich meal results in lower RER and greater DIT. However, after a 5-d high-fat diet, the change in metabolic responses was greater in the PUFA diet, showing the metabolic adaptability of a PUFA-rich diet.",2018,Jul,Br J Nutr,120,1,13-22,,10.1017/S0007114518001332,29936922,#5979,Polley 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"No evidence of differential effects of SFA, MUFA or PUFA on post-ingestive satiety and energy intake: a randomised trial of fatty acid saturation.",Strik CM; Lithander FE; McGill AT; MacGibbon AK; McArdle BH; Poppitt SD,"BACKGROUND: High fat diets have long been associated with weight gain and obesity, and the weak satiety response elicited in response to dietary lipids is likely to play a role. Suppression of appetite and food intake has consistently been shown to be diminished with high fat relative to either high protein or carbohydrate meals. There is however some evidence that the satiating capacity of lipids may be modulated when physicochemical properties are altered, but studies investigating the effect of lipid saturation on appetite have generated inconsistent findings. This study investigated the effects of changes in fatty acid saturation on post-ingestive satiety and energy intake. METHODS: High-fat (HF) test breakfasts (2.0 MJ) containing 26 g lipid were given to 18 healthy, lean men in a 3 treatment randomised cross-over design, each treatment separated by a washout of at least 3 days. The breakfasts were high in saturated (SFA, 65% of total fat), polyunsaturated (PUFA, 76%) or monounsaturated (MUFA, 76%) fatty acids, and comprised 2 savoury muffins. Participants rated appetite sensations using visual analogue scales (VAS) to assess palatability immediately following the meals, and hunger and fullness prior to the HF breakfast and throughout the day. Energy intake was measured by covert weighing of a lunch meal which was served 3.5 h after the breakfast, and from which the participants ate ad libitum. RESULTS: There was no difference in VAS ratings of pleasantness, visual appearance, smell, taste, aftertaste and overall palatability between the 3 high-fat test breakfasts. However, there was also no differential effect of the 3 treatments on ratings of hunger, fullness, satisfaction or prospective food consumption during the 3.5 h following the breakfast meal and over the full 6 h experiment. Energy and macronutrient intake at lunch also did not differ between treatments (mean, sem; SFA: 5275.9 +/- 286.5 kJ; PUFA: 5227.7 +/- 403.9 kJ; MUFA: 5215.6 +/- 329.5 kJ; P > 0.05). The maximum difference in energy intake between treatments was less than 2%. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a difference in post-ingestion satiety between high fat meals which differed in saturation profile in this group of lean, healthy men.",2010,May,Nutr J,9,,24,,10.1186/1475-2891-9-24,20492735,#5991,Strik 2010,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
An Isoenergetic Multifactorial Diet Reduces Pancreatic Fat and Increases Postprandial Insulin Response in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,Della Pepa G; Brancato V; Costabile G; Salamone D; Corrado A; Vitale M; Cavaliere C; Mancini M; Salvatore M; Luongo D; Riccardi G; Rivellese AA; Annuzzi G; Bozzetto L,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of an isocaloric multifactorial diet with a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and similar macronutrient composition on pancreatic fat (PF) and postprandial insulin response in type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: According to a randomized controlled parallel-group design, 39 individuals with T2D, 35-75 years old, in satisfactory blood glucose control, were assigned to an 8 week isocaloric intervention with a multifactorial diet rich in MUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, polyphenols, and vitamins (n = 18) or a MUFA-rich diet (n = 21). Before/after the intervention, PF content was measured by the proton-density fat fraction using a three-dimensional mDIXON MRI sequence, and plasma insulin and glucose concentrations were measured over a 4 h test meal with a similar composition as the assigned diet. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, PF significantly decreased after the multifactorial diet (from 15.7 ± 6.5% to 14.1 ± 6.3%; P = 0.024), while it did not change after the MUFA diet (from 17.1 ± 10.1% to 18.6 ± 10.6%; P = 0.139) with a significant difference between diets (P = 0.014). Postprandial glucose response was similar in the two groups. Early postprandial insulin response (incremental postprandial areas under the curve [iAUC0-120]) significantly increased with the multifactorial diet (from 36,340 ± 34,954 to 44,138 ± 31,878 pmol/L/min; P = 0.037), while it did not change significantly in the MUFA diet (from 31,754 ± 18,446 to 26,976 ± 12,265 pmol/L/min; P = 0.178), with a significant difference between diets (P = 0.023). Changes in PF inversely correlated with changes in early postprandial insulin response (r = -0.383; P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2D, an isocaloric multifactorial diet, including several beneficial dietary components, markedly reduced PF. This reduction was associated with an improved postprandial insulin response.",2022,Sep,Diabetes Care,45,9,1935-1942,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03380416figshare/10.2337/figshare.20188583,10.2337/dc22-0605,35862001,#5993,DellaPepa 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Association of dietary fatty acids intake with pro-coagulation and inflammation in Saudi Adults.,Al-Attas OS; Al-Daghri NM; Alokail MS; Alkharfy KM; Khan N; Alfawaz HA; Aiswaidan IA; Al-Ajlan AS; Chrousos GP,"The aim of the study was to understand whether dietary fatty acids such as saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids act as inflammatory mediators or influence pro-coagulation in Saudi adults. The study sought to examine inflammatory factors such as C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and activated plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. A total number of 232 consenting Saudi adults, aged 18-60 years were randomly selected in this cross-sectional study. Independent Student t-test was done to compare means of normally distributed data. Spearman correlation between the variables was determined. The values of different fatty acids and adipokines were transformed logarithmically/square root to normalize data before correlations were determined and statistical analyses performed. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The results show a significant positive correlation of dietary intake of poly and monounsaturated fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids, with activated plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (r=0.31, p=0.02, r=0.32 p=0.04). On the other hand, dietary intake of saturated fatty acids showed a negative correlation with serum C-reactive protein levels (p=0.001) in males. Dietary unsaturated fatty acids is possibly associated with the production of a pro-coagulation factor without enhancing the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules, while saturated fatty acids have no effect on activated plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, but their level is negatively associated with the inflammatory factor C-reactive protein. We conclude that dietary intake may exert a gender-specific effect in inflammatory processes among adults. Further studies are warranted to confirm present findings.",2014,,Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,23,1,55-64,,10.6133/apjcn.2014.23.1.12,24561973,#5995,Al-Attas 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Associations of Monounsaturated Fatty Acids From Plant and Animal Sources With Total and Cause-Specific Mortality in Two US Prospective Cohort Studies.,Guasch-Ferré M; Zong G; Willett WC; Zock PL; Wanders AJ; Hu FB; Sun Q,"RATIONALE: Dietary monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) can come from both plant and animal sources with divergent nutrient profiles that may potentially obscure the associations of total MUFAs with chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of cis-MUFA intake from plant (MUFA-P) and animal (MUFA-A) sources with total and cause-specific mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed 63 412 women from the NHS (Nurses' Health Study; 1990-2012) and 29 966 men from the HPFS (Health Professionals Follow-Up Study; 1990-2012). MUFA-Ps and MUFA-As were calculated based on data collected through validated food frequency questionnaires administered every 4 years and updated food composition databases. During 1 896 864 person-years of follow-up, 20 672 deaths occurred. Total MUFAs and MUFA-Ps were inversely associated with total mortality after adjusting for potential confounders, whereas MUFA-As were associated with higher mortality. When MUFA-Ps were modeled to isocalorically replace other macronutrients, hazard ratios (HRs, 95% CIs) of total mortality were 0.84 (0.77-0.92; P<0.001) for replacing saturated fatty acids, 5% of energy); 0.86 (0.82-0.91; P<0.001) for replacing refined carbohydrates (5% energy); 0.91 (0.85-0.97; P<0.001) for replacing trans fats (2% energy), and 0.77 (0.71-0.82; P<0.001) for replacing MUFA-As (5% energy). For isocalorically replacing MUFA-As with MUFA-Ps, HRs (95% CIs) were 0.74 (0.64-0.86; P<0.001) for cardiovascular mortality; 0.73 (0.65-0.82; P<0.001) for cancer mortality, and 0.82 (0.73-0.91; P<0.001) for mortality because of other causes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of MUFA-Ps was associated with lower total mortality, and MUFA-As intake was associated with higher mortality. Significantly lower mortality risk was observed when saturated fatty acids, refined carbohydrates, or trans fats were replaced by MUFA-Ps, but not MUFA-As. These data suggest that other constituents in animal foods, such as saturated fatty acids, may confound the associations for MUFAs when they are primarily derived from animal products. More evidence is needed to elucidate the differential associations of MUFA-Ps and MUFA-As with mortality.",2019,Apr,Circ Res,124,8,1266-1275,,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313996,30689516,#5996,Guasch-Ferré 2019,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Disentangling the Effects of Monounsaturated Fatty Acids from Other Components of a Mediterranean Diet on Serum Metabolite Profiles: A Randomized Fully Controlled Dietary Intervention in Healthy Subjects at Risk of the Metabolic Syndrome.,Michielsen CCJR; Hangelbroek RWJ; Feskens EJM; Afman LA,"SCOPE: The Mediterranean (MED) diet has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is unclear whether this health effect can be mainly contributed to high intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), characteristic for the MED diet, or whether other components of a MED diet also play an important role. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized fully controlled parallel trial is performed to examine the effects of the consumption of a saturated fatty acid rich diet, a MUFA-rich diet, or a MED diet for 8 weeks on metabolite profiles, in 47 subjects at risk of the metabolic syndrome. A total of 162 serum metabolites are assessed before and after the intervention by using a targeted NMR platform. Fifty-two metabolites are changed during the intervention (false discovery rate [FDR] p < 0.05). Both the MUFA and MED diet decrease exactly the same fractions of LDL, including particle number, lipid, phospholipid, and free cholesterol fraction (FDR p < 0.05). The MED diet additionally decreases the larger subclasses of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), related VLDL fractions, VLDL-triglycerides, and serum-triglycerides (FDR p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings clearly demonstrate that the MUFA component is responsible for reducing LDL subclasses and fractions, and therefore causes an antiatherogenic lipid profile. Interestingly, consumption of the other components in the MED diet show additional health effects.",2019,May,Mol Nutr Food Res,63,9,e1801095,,10.1002/mnfr.201801095,30725537,#5997,MichielsenCCJR 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Liver fat is reduced by an isoenergetic MUFA diet in a controlled randomized study in type 2 diabetic patients.,Bozzetto L; Prinster A; Annuzzi G; Costagliola L; Mangione A; Vitelli A; Mazzarella R; Longobardo M; Mancini M; Vigorito C; Riccardi G; Rivellese AA,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of qualitative dietary changes and the interaction with aerobic exercise training on liver fat content independent of weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: With use of a factorial 2 × 2 randomized parallel-group design, 37 men and 8 women, aged 35-70 years, with type 2 diabetes in satisfactory blood glucose control on diet or diet plus metformin treatment were assigned to one of the following groups for an 8-week period: 1) high-carbohydrate/high-fiber/low-glycemic index diet (CHO/fiber group), 2) high-MUFA diet (MUFA group), 3) high-carbohydrate/high-fiber/low-glycemic index diet plus physical activity program (CHO/fiber+Ex group), and 4) high-MUFA diet plus physical activity program (MUFA+Ex group). Before and after intervention, hepatic fat content was measured by (1)H NMR. RESULTS: Dietary compliance was optimal and body weight remained stable in all groups. Liver fat content decreased more in MUFA (-29%) and MUFA+Ex (-25%) groups than in CHO/fiber (-4%) and CHO/fiber+Ex groups (-6%). Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, including baseline values as covariate, showed a significant effect on liver fat content for diet (P = 0.006), with no effects for exercise training (P = 0.789) or diet-exercise interaction (P = 0.712). CONCLUSIONS: An isocaloric diet enriched in MUFA compared with a diet higher in carbohydrate and fiber was associated with a clinically relevant reduction of hepatic fat content in type 2 diabetic patients independent of an aerobic training program and should be considered for the nutritional management of hepatic steatosis in people with type 2 diabetes.",2012,Jul,Diabetes Care,35,7,1429-35,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01025856,10.2337/dc12-0033,22723581,#5998,Bozzetto 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Monounsaturated fats from plant and animal sources in relation to risk of coronary heart disease among US men and women.,Zong G; Li Y; Sampson L; Dougherty LW; Willett WC; Wanders AJ; Alssema M; Zock PL; Hu FB; Sun Q,"BACKGROUND: Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) improve blood lipid profiles in intervention studies, but prospective evidence with regard to MUFA intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk is limited and controversial. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the associations of cis MUFA intake from plant (MUFA-P) and animal (MUFA-A) sources with CHD risk separately among 63,442 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1990-2012) and 29,942 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1990-2012). DESIGN: Intakes of MUFA-Ps and MUFA-As were calculated by using validated food-frequency questionnaires collected every 4 y. Incident nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD cases (n = 4419) were confirmed by medical record review. RESULTS: During follow-up, MUFA-Ps and MUFA-As contributed 5.8-7.9% and 4.2-5.4% of energy on average, respectively. When MUFA-Ps were modeled to isocalorically replace other macronutrients, HRs (95% CIs) of CHD were 0.83 (0.68, 1.00) for saturated fatty acids (SFAs; 5% of energy), 0.86 (0.76, 0.97) for refined carbohydrates (5% of energy), and 0.80 (0.70, 0.91) for trans fats (2% of energy) (P = 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively). For MUFA-As, corresponding HRs (95% CIs) for the same isocaloric substitutions were 1.04 (0.79, 1.38) for SFAs, 1.11 (0.91, 1.35) for refined carbohydrates, and 0.88 (0.77, 1.01) for trans fats (P = 0.76, 0.31, and 0.08, respectively). Given the common food sources of SFAs and MUFA-As (Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.81-0.83 between these groups of fatty acids), we further estimated CHD risk when the sum of MUFA-As and SFAs (5% of energy) was replaced by MUFA-Ps, and found that the HR was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.90; P < 0.001) for this replacement. CONCLUSIONS: The largely different associations of MUFA-Ps and MUFA-As with CHD risk suggest that plant-based foods are the preferable sources of MUFAs for CHD prevention.

Relationship of dietary monounsaturated fatty acids to blood pressure: the International Study of Macro/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure.,Miura K; Stamler J; Brown IJ; Ueshima H; Nakagawa H; Sakurai M; Chan Q; Appel LJ; Okayama A; Okuda N; Curb JD; Rodriguez BL; Robertson C; Zhao L; Elliott P,"OBJECTIVE: In short-term feeding trials, replacement of other macronutrients with monounsaturated fatty acid reduces blood pressure. However, observational studies have not clearly demonstrated a relationship between monounsaturated fatty acid intake and blood pressure. We report associations of monounsaturated fatty acid intake of individuals with blood pressure in a cross-sectional study. METHODS: The International Study of Macro/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure is a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of 4680 men and women ages 40-59 years from 17 population samples in China, Japan, UK and USA. Nutrient intake data were based on four in-depth multipass 24-h dietary recalls/person and two-timed 24-h urine collections/person. Blood pressure was measured eight times at four visits. RESULTS: Mean monounsaturated fatty acid intake ranged from 8.1%kcal (China) to 12.2%kcal (USA). With sequential models to control for possible confounders (dietary, other), linear regression analyses showed significant inverse relationship of total monounsaturated fatty acid intake with DBP for all participants; for 2238 'nonintervened' individuals, the relationship was stronger. Estimated DBP differences with 2-SD higher monounsaturated fatty acids (5.35%kcal) were -0.82 mmHg (P < 0.05) for all participants and -1.70 mmHg (P < 0.01) for nonintervened individuals. Inverse associations of dietary total oleic acid (main monounsaturated) with blood pressure in nonintervened individuals were not significant, but those of oleic acid from vegetable sources were stronger and significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dietary monounsaturated fatty acid intake, especially oleic acid from vegetable sources, may contribute to prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels in general populations.",2013,Jun,J Hypertens,31,6,1144-50,,10.1097/HJH.0b013e3283604016,23572200,#6004,Miura 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary Fats and Cardio-Metabolic Outcomes in a Cohort of Italian Adults.,Currenti W; Godos J; Alanazi AM; Grosso G; Cincione RI; La Vignera S; Buscemi S; Galvano F,"BACKGROUND: Dietary fats, and especially saturated fatty acid (SFA), have been blamed for being the culprit in the dramatic increase in obesity and its associated diseases. However multiple systematic reviews and recent meta-analyses do not support the association between SFA and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the objective of this study was to test whether specific types and subtypes of dietary fats are associated with metabolic outcomes in a cohort of Italian adults. METHODS: Nutritional and demographic data of 1936 adults living in the south of Italy were examined. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were administered to assess the intake of total dietary fat and each specific class of dietary fat, such as SFA, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). The intake of fatty acids was also examined according to the carbon-chain length of each individual class. Cases of hypertension, type-2 diabetes and dyslipidemias were collected from previous doctor-confirmed diagnosis records (or direct measurement of blood pressure). RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounding factors, individuals reporting higher intakes of total and saturated fats were associated with lower likelihood of having hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.91 and OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.89, respectively). Moreover, higher intake of short-chain saturated fatty acids (SCSFAs) and medium-chain saturated fatty acids (MCSFAs) was inversely associated with dyslipidemia and diabetes (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.82 and OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.72, respectively). Among MUFAs, C18:1 was inversely associated with hypertension and diabetes (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.92 and OR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.67, respectively), while C14:1 intake was inversely associated only with hypertension (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.88). In contrast, C20:1 intake was associated with dyslipidemia (OR = 3.35, 95% CI: 1.33, 8.42). Regarding PUFA, C18:2 and 20:5 were inversely associated with hypertension (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.60 and OR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.89, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of SFA does not seem to be harmful to cardio-metabolic health and, on the contrary, SCSFA may exert beneficial effects. Further studies are needed to clearly validate the results of the present study.",2022,Oct,Nutrients,14,20,,,10.3390/nu14204294,36296979,#6005,Currenti 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Influence of Avocado Purée as a Fat Replacer on Nutritional, Fatty Acid, and Organoleptic Properties of Low-Fat Muffins.",Othman NA; Abdul Manaf M; Harith S; Wan Ishak WR,"OBJECTIVE: The feasibility of developing reduced-fat muffins with avocado is investigated by preparing muffins with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% avocado purée as a fat (butter) replacer. METHODOLOGY: The resulting products were compared to the control muffin, which was made with 100% butter. Muffins were analyzed for nutritional content, fatty acid profiles, and sensory acceptability. RESULT: Muffins incorporated with avocado purée revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05) with respect to moisture, ash, and carbohydrate in comparison with the control sample. However, no significant changes (p > 0.05) were detected in all muffin formulations for protein and dietary fiber content. Both fat content and caloric value of muffins incorporated with avocado purée were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The fatty acid profile showed that there was an increment in the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) content by 16.51% at full-fat substitution. The sensory evaluation test demonstrated that muffins had acceptability at up to 50% substitution. Fat substitution at higher than 50% lead to undesirable flavor and aftertaste, which was significant (p < 0.05) to the panelists.

Dietary fat intake and risk of disabling hearing impairment: a prospective population-based cohort study.,Yévenes-Briones H; Caballero FF; Struijk EA; Lana A; Rodríguez-Artalejo F; Lopez-Garcia E,"PURPOSE: To examine the associations of specific dietary fats with the risk of disabling hearing impairment in the UK Biobank study. METHODS: This cohort study investigated 105,592 participants (47,308 men and 58,284 women) aged ≥ 40 years. Participants completed a minimum of one valid 24-h recall (Oxford Web-Q). Dietary intake of total fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), saturated fatty acids (SFA), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was assessed at baseline. Functional auditory capacity was measured with a digit triplet test (DTT), and disabling hearing impairment was defined as a speech reception threshold in noise > - 3.5 dB in any physical exam performed during the follow-up. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 3.2 (SD: 2.1) years, 832 men and 872 women developed disabling hearing impairment. After adjustment for potential confounders, including lifestyles, exposure to high-intensity sounds, ototoxic medication and comorbidity, the hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence interval (CI) of disabling hearing function, comparing extreme quintiles of intakes were 0.91 (0.71-1.17) for total fat, 1.09 (0.83-1.44) for PUFA, 0.85 (0.64-1.13) for SFA and 1.01 (0.74-1.36) for MUFA among men. Among women, HRs comparing extreme intakes were 0.98 (0.78-1.24) for total fat, 0.69 (0.53-0.91) for PUFA, 1.26 (0.96-1.65) for SFA, and 0.91 (0.68-1.23) for MUFA. Replacing 5% of energy intake from SFA with an equivalent energy from PUFA was associated with 25% risk reduction (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.74-0.77) among women.

Monounsaturated fatty acids might be key factors in the Mediterranean diet that suppress rheumatoid arthritis disease activity: The TOMORROW study.,Matsumoto Y; Sugioka Y; Tada M; Okano T; Mamoto K; Inui K; Habu D; Koike T,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Mediterranean diet is reportedly effective in suppressing disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the key elements responsible for this effect remain unknown. The presented study therefore aimed to identify such elements. METHODS: This study included 208 consecutive patients with RA (RA group) and 205 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (controls) from the prospective ""TOMORROW"" cohort study that has been ongoing since 2010 were included in this study. Food and nutrient intake was assessed using the brief self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ), Mediterranean diet scores were calculated based on intake by controls and disease activity was determined from disease activity scores in 28 joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (DAS28-ESR). RESULTS: Intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was significantly lower in the RA, than in the control group (P = 0.003) and the ratio of consumed monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid (MUFA/SFA) significantly differed within the RA group after being sub-classified according to DAS28-ESR. Moreover, DAS28-ESR significantly correlated with MUFA/SFA intake after age adjustment (R = -0.228, P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis selected high MUFA intake as an independent predictor of remission in the RA group with borderline boundary significance (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 0.98-3.98; P = 0.057). Changes in DAS28-ESR between 2010 and 2011 significantly correlated with MUFA/SFA intake after age adjustment (R = 0.180, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Daily MUFA intake, a component of the Mediterranean diet score, might suppress disease activity in RA patients.",2018,Apr,Clin Nutr,37,2,675-680,,10.1016/j.clnu.2017.02.011,28285975,#6016,Matsumoto 2018,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
"Monounsaturated fatty acid, carbohydrate intake, and diabetes status are associated with arterial pulse pressure.",Vaccaro JA; Huffman FG,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a global epidemic. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most prevalent consequences of diabetes. Nutrition is considered a modifiable risk factor for CVD, particularly for individuals with diabetes; albeit, there is little consensus on the role of carbohydrates, proteins and fats for arterial health for persons with or without diabetes. In this study, we examined the association of macronutrients with arterial pulse pressure (APP), a surrogate measure of arterial health by diabetes status and race. METHODS: Participants were 892 Mexican Americans (MA), 1059 Black, non-Hispanics (BNH) and 2473 White, non-Hispanics (WNH) with and without diabetes of a weighted sample from the National Nutrition and Health Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008. The cross-sectional analysis was performed with IBM-SPSS version 18 with the complex sample analysis module. The two-year sample weight for the sub-sample with laboratory values was applied to reduce bias and approximate a nationally, representative sample. Arterial stiffness was assessed by arterial pulse pressure (APP). RESULTS: APP was higher for MA [B = 0.063 (95% CI 0.015 to 0.111), p = 0.013] and BNH [B = 0.044 (95% CI 0.006 to 0.082), p = 0.018] than WNH, controlling for diabetes, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), fiber intake, energy intake (Kcal) and smoking. A two-way interaction of diabetes by carbohydrate intake (grams) was inversely associated with APP [B = -1.18 (95% CI -0.178 to -0.058), p = 0.001], controlling for race, age, gender, BMI, Kcal and smoking. BNH with diabetes who consumed more mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) than WNH with diabetes had lower APP [B = -0.112 (95%CI-0.179 to -0.045), p = 0.003] adjusting for saturated fatty acids, Kcal, age, gender, BMI and smoking. CONCLUSION: Higher MUFA and carbohydrate intake for persons with diabetes reflecting lower APP may be due to replacement of saturated fats with CHO and MUFA. The associations of APP with diabetes, race and dietary intake need to be confirmed with intervention and prospective studies. Confirmation of these results would suggest that dietary interventions for minorities with diabetes may improve arterial health.",2011,Nov,Nutr J,10,,126,,10.1186/1475-2891-10-126,22087563,#6017,Vaccaro 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Monounsaturated fat intake is associated with improved sleep quality in pregnancy.,Bennett CJ; Cain SW; Blumfield ML,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between sleeping behaviour and macronutrient intake of pregnant women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data collected in 2009 as part of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. SETTING: Australia PARTICIPANTS: Australian pregnant women (n = 437, aged 31-36) enrolled in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health who completed Survey 5 in 2009. MEASUREMENTS: Pregnant women self-reported sleep and dietary data. Latent class analysis derived sleep patterns. Relationships between sleep and diet were investigated through multivariate linear regression controlling for confounders including: area of residence, body mass index, depression, difficulty managing on income, education level and parity. FINDINGS: Latent class analysis identified three sleeping behaviour patterns: (LC1) average sleep (∼7.8 h) with no adverse sleep-related symptoms (n = 167); (LC2) average sleep (∼8.3 h) with adverse sleep symptoms (n = 193); and (LC3) short sleep (∼6.6 h) with adverse sleep symptoms (n = 97). After adjusting for potential confounders, LC2 was associated lower percentage energy (%E) total fat (b= -0.032, p = 0.039) and%E monounsaturated fat (b = -0.050, p = 0.005) and higher intake of%E carbohydrate (b = 0.031, p = 0.020), compared to LC1. No differences were found between LC1 and LC3. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Higher monounsaturated fat intake, at the expense of carbohydrate intake, may prove protective against poor sleep quality in pregnancy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Antenatal support provided by health professionals should consider the important relationship between dietary intake and sleeping behaviour. Encouraging pregnant women to improve their sleep quality may prove an important strategy to optimise dietary intake during pregnancy and consequently improve the health outcomes for both mother and child.",2019,Nov,Midwifery,78,,64-70,,10.1016/j.midw.2019.07.019,31376641,#6021,Bennett 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Habitual dietary fat intake and risk of muscle weakness and lower-extremity functional impairment in older adults: A prospective cohort study.,Arias-Fernández L; Struijk EA; Rodríguez-Artalejo F; Lopez-Garcia E; Lana A,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fatty acid supplementation increases muscle mass and function in older adults, but the effect of habitual dietary intake is uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association between habitual dietary fat intake and risk of muscle weakness and lower-extremity functional impairment (LEFI) in older adults. METHODS: Prospective study with 1873 individuals aged ≥60 years from the Seniors-ENRICA cohort. In 2008-10 and 2012, a validated face-to-face diet history was used to record the one-year consumption of up to 880 foods. Then, fatty acids, other nutrients and energy intake were estimated using standard food composition tables. Means of intake between these years were calculated to represent cumulative consumption over the follow-up. Study participants were followed up through 2015 to assess incident muscle weakness (lowest quintile of grip strength) and incident LEFI (Short Physical Performance Battery score ≤6). Analyses were performed with Cox regression and adjusted for the main confounders, including other types of fatty acids. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 331 participants developed muscle weakness and 397 LEFI. Intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) did not show an association with muscle weakness but was associated with higher risk of LEFI (multivariable hazard ratio (HR) for tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: 1.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.05-2.01; p-trend = 0.02). This association was mostly due to consumption of Spanish cold cuts and pastry and, to a lesser extent, dairy. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) intake was associated with lower risk of muscle weakness (HR t3 vs. t1: 0.73; 0.54-0.99; p trend = 0.04), and intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was associated with reduced risk of both muscle weakness (0.70; 0.52-0.95; p-trend = 0.02) and LEFI (0.49; 0.35-0.68; p-trend <0.001). Olive oil and blue fish, the main sources of MUFA and PUFA, were also associated with lower risk of muscle weakness and LEFI. CONCLUSIONS: Habitual intake of SFA was associated with increased risk of LEFI. By contrast, habitual intake of MUFA and PUFA were associated with lower risk of physical performance impairment.",2020,Dec,Clin Nutr,39,12,3663-3670,,10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.018,32273201,#6024,Arias-Fernández 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Hunger and satiety responses to high-fat meals of varying fatty acid composition in women with obesity.,Stevenson JL; Clevenger HC; Cooper JA,"OBJECTIVE: Determine subjective and physiological appetite responses and ad libitum intake to high-fat (HF) meals rich in either monounsaturated (MUFAs), polyunsaturated (PUFAs), or saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in women with obesity. METHODS: In this single-blind crossover study, three HF meals (70% of energy) rich in MUFAs, PUFAs, or SFAs in 16 women with obesity were tested. At each visit, anthropometrics and a fasting blood sample were collected. Participants then consumed one of the HF meals, and postprandial blood draws and visual analog scale (VAS) measures were collected over 5 h. An ad libitum buffet lunch was provided 5 h after the HF meal. RESULTS: Decrease in ghrelin was significantly greater for PUFA (P < 0.05) and MUFA (P < 0.01) vs. SFA while the increase in peptide YY was significantly greater for PUFA vs. both SFA and MUFA (P < 0.05). Change in glucagon-like peptide-1, VAS measurements, or total energy consumed at the buffet showed no differences between HF meals (ns).

"Body composition, not dietary fatty acid composition, explains metabolic responses following a high-fat meal in premenopausal normal-weight women: a single-blind, randomised, crossover study.",Graybeal AJ; Willis JL,"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of three different fatty acid (FA)-rich meals enriched in either SFA, MUFA or PUFA on postprandial metabolic responses in premenopausal, normal-weight women. For this randomised, single-blind, crossover study, three high-fat (HF) meals rich in either SFA, MUFA or PUFA (65 % energy from fat; 35 % of participants' total daily energy needs) were tested. For each visit, anthropometrics and RMR were measured following a 12-15 h fast. Then, participants consumed one of the HF meals, and respiratory gases were collected using indirect calorimetry for 3 h postprandially. Energy expenditure (EE) following a SFA-rich meal was significantly higher than a MUFA-rich meal (P = 0·04; η2 = 0·19), but SFA was not significantly different from PUFA. There was a trend towards significance in EE between PUFA and MUFA (P = 0·06). After adjusting for fat-free mass (FFM), there were no longer condition or time effects for EE, although FFM remained a significant predictor (P = 0·005; η2 = 0·45). There were no significant differences between conditions for dietary-induced thermogenesis or substrate oxidation. The relationship between fat mass (FM) and both total fat oxidation (r 0·62; P = 0·025) and total change in RER following a MUFA-rich meal was observed (r -0·55; P = 0·05). In conclusion, weight loss through increases in EE may be best achieved by increasing FFM rather than selection of FA type. Further, a relationship exists between FM and fat oxidation following a MUFA-rich meal, most likely due to an unidentified mechanism.",2021,Sep,Br J Nutr,126,5,663-673,,10.1017/S0007114520004419,33143774,#6029,Graybeal 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of substituting saturated with monounsaturated fatty acids on serum visfatin levels and insulin resistance in overweight women: a randomized cross-over clinical trial.,Haghighatdoost F; Hosseinzadeh-Attar MJ; Kabiri A; Eshraghian M; Esmaillzadeh A,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effects of a monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-rich diet on serum visfatin, interleukin-6 and insulin levels among overweight women. DESIGN: In this randomized cross-over clinical trial, 17 premenopausal overweight women were included. Participants were randomly assigned to consume either a hypocaloric, saturated fatty acids (SFA)-rich diet (16% SFA and 8% MUFA) or a hypocaloric, MUFA-rich diet (16% MUFA and 8% SFA) for 12 weeks crossing over after a 2-week washout period. Percentages of energy from other macronutrients were similar between the two diets. Biochemical and anthropometric assessments were done at the first and at the end of each period. Statistical analyses were done using paired t-test. In all statistical analysis, p < 0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: The participant's mean body mass index was 27.6 kg/m². Mean percentages of MUFA intake were 13% during MUFA-rich diet and 7% during SFA-rich diet. The corresponding values for SFA intake were 8.5% and 14%, respectively. We failed to find any significant differences between two intervention diets in terms of their effect on the serum levels of IL-6, visfatin and insulin. However, serum visfatin and IL-6 levels increased during the SFA-rich diet (0.4 ± 0.4 ng/ml and 0.19 ± 0.3 pg/ml, respectively) and decreased during the MUFA-rich diet (-0.7 ± 0.5 ng/ml and -0.17 ± 0.3 pg/ml, respectively). In spite of a slight reduction in both periods, changes in serum insulin levels did not reach significant levels comparing the two periods.

"Effects of dietary saturated, monounsaturated, and n-3 fatty acids on blood pressure in healthy subjects.",Rasmussen BM; Vessby B; Uusitupa M; Berglund L; Pedersen E; Riccardi G; Rivellese AA; Tapsell L; Hermansen K,"BACKGROUND: The quantity and quality of fats consumed in the diet influence the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although the effect of diet on plasma lipids and lipoproteins is well documented, less information exists on the role of fats on blood pressure (BP). OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effects of different types of dietary fat on BP in healthy subjects. DESIGN: Healthy subjects (n = 162) were randomly assigned for 3 mo to follow 1 of 2 isoenergetic diets: 1 rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA diet) and the other rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA diet). Each group was further randomly assigned to receive supplementation with fish oil (3.6 g n-3 fatty acids/d) or placebo. RESULTS: Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) decreased with the MUFA diet [-2.2% (P = 0.009) and -3.8% (P = 0.0001), respectively] but did not change with the SFA diet [-1.0% (P = 0.2084) and -1.1% (P = 0.2116)]. The MUFA diet caused a significantly lower DBP than did the SFA diet (P = 0.0475). Interestingly, the favorable effects of MUFA on DBP disappeared at a total fat intake above the median (>37% of energy). The addition of n-3 fatty acids influenced neither SBP nor DBP. CONCLUSIONS: Changing the proportions of dietary fat by decreasing SFAs and increasing MUFAs decreased diastolic BP. Interestingly, the beneficial effect on BP induced by fat quality was negated by the consumption of a high total fat intake.

High-monounsaturated fatty acid diets lower both plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations.,Kris-Etherton PM; Pearson TA; Wan Y; Hargrove RL; Moriarty K; Fishell V; Etherton TD,"BACKGROUND: Low-fat diets increase plasma triacylglycerol and decrease HDL-cholesterol concentrations, thereby potentially adversely affecting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. High-monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), cholesterol-lowering diets do not raise triacylglycerol or lower HDL cholesterol, but little is known about how peanut products, a rich source of MUFAs, affect CVD risk. OBJECTIVE: The present study compared the CVD risk profile of an Average American diet (AAD) with those of 4 cholesterol-lowering diets: an American Heart Association/National Cholesterol Education Program Step II diet and 3 high-MUFA diets [olive oil (OO), peanut oil (PO), and peanuts and peanut butter (PPB)]. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, 5-period crossover study design (n = 22) was used to examine the effects of the diets on serum lipids and lipoproteins: AAD [34% fat; 16% saturated fatty acids (SFAs), 11% MUFAs], Step II (25% fat; 7% SFAs, 12% MUFAs), OO (34% fat; 7% SFAs, 21% MUFAs), PO (34% fat; 7% SFAs, 17% MUFAs), and PPB (36% fat; 8% SFAs, 18% MUFAs). RESULTS: The high-MUFA diets lowered total cholesterol by 10% and LDL cholesterol by 14%. This response was comparable with that observed for the Step II diet. Triacylglycerol concentrations were 13% lower in subjects consuming the high-MUFA diets and were 11% higher with the Step II diet than with the AAD. The high-MUFA diets did not lower HDL cholesterol whereas the Step II diet lowered it by 4% compared with the AAD. The OO, PO, and PPB diets decreased CVD risk by an estimated 25%, 16%, and 21%, respectively, whereas the Step II diet lowered CVD risk by 12%.

Effects of dietary monounsaturated fatty acids on plasma lipids in humans.,Chang NW; Huang PC,"In order to test whether monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, M) would lower plasma cholesterol and/or triglycerides (TG), 14 young men were studied in a metabolism ward. They were given two experimental diets with the same P/S ratio (P: polyunsaturated; S:saturated fatty acids) but different P + M/S ratios in composition of dietary fatty acids. Six men were in experiment I. In two groups of three, each group was given either the high or the low P + M/S ratio diet for 6 weeks. In experiment II, two groups of four men were subjected to a 3-week cross-over feeding trial (total of 6 weeks). We found in the crossover study that when the dietary P/S ratio was fixed at 1.0, those subjects given a diet with the higher P + M/S ratio of 4.5 showed significantly higher plasma total TG, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-TG, and LDL-cholesterol than when given a diet with a lower P + M/S ratio of 1.5. Plasma total cholesterol, apoprotein A-I, and apoprotein B-100 were not significantly different between the two dietary periods. Plasma fatty acid patterns showed a significantly higher plasma MUFA level during the period of a higher P + M/S diet. In contrast to some recent reports, our studies indicate that a large amount of dietary MUFA may raise some fractions of plasma lipids in humans.",1990,Dec,J Lipid Res,31,12,2141-7,,,2090708,#6041,Chang 1990,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary monounsaturated fat activates metabolic pathways for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that involve apolipoproteins E and C-III.,Zheng C; Khoo C; Furtado J; Ikewaki K; Sacks FM,"BACKGROUND: Dietary monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and complex carbohydrates have different effects on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that apolipoprotein (apo) E and apo C-III might be involved in these dietary effects because of their crucial role in TRL metabolism. DESIGN: Twelve adults consumed, for 3 wk each, 2 isocaloric diets: first a carbohydrate-rich diet (48% complex carbohydrate, 8% MUFAs) and then a MUFA-rich diet (31% complex carbohydrate, 24% MUFAs) 12 mo later. The dietary composition of other macronutrients in the 2 diets was similar. Body weight was kept constant. Postprandial apo B kinetic studies using stable-isotope tracers were performed after each dietary intervention. Multiple VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL fractions were prepared on the basis of apo E and apo C-III contents. RESULTS: The MUFA diet increased by approximately 4-6-fold, the secretion of VLDLs and IDLs containing both apo E and apo C-III (E+CIII+) (P < 0.05). These are TRLs that mostly cleared from the circulation and are minor precursors of LDL. The MUFA diet also decreased by 60% (P < 0.05) the secretion of the TRLs without apo E or apo C-III (major precursors of LDL in plasma) and decreased their flux to LDLs. Total LDL flux did not change because the MUFA diet increased the flux to LDL from E-CIII+ TRLs, a process that requires the removal of apo C-III. In addition, the MUFA diet significantly increased the TRL fractional catabolic rate by 50% and doubled the percentage of TRLs that were cleared rather than being converted to LDLs. CONCLUSION: MUFA intake activates synthetic and rapid catabolic pathways for TRL metabolism that involve apo E and apo C-III and suppresses the metabolism of more slowly metabolized VLDLs and IDLs, which do not contain these apolipoproteins.",2008,Aug,Am J Clin Nutr,88,2,272-81,,10.1093/ajcn/88.2.272,18689361,#6047,Zheng 2008,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Postprandial Lipid Metabolism in Normolipidemic Subjects and Patients with Mild to Moderate Hypertriglyceridemia: Effects of Test Meals Containing Saturated Fatty Acids, Mono-Unsaturated Fatty Acids, or Medium-Chain Fatty Acids.",Folwaczny A; Waldmann E; Altenhofer J; Henze K; Parhofer KG,"Fasting and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia are causal risk factors for atherosclerosis. The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia is approximately 25-30% and most hypertriglyceridemic patients suffer from mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Data regarding dietary interventions on postprandial triglyceride metabolism of mildly to moderately hypertriglyceridemic patients is, however, sparse. In a randomized controlled trial, eight mildly hypertriglyceridemic patients and five healthy, normolipidemic controls received three separate standardized fat-meals containing either saturated fatty acids (SFA), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), or medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) in a randomized order. Fasting and postprandial lipid parameters were determined over a 10 h period and the (incremental) area under the curve (AUC/iAUC) for plasma triglycerides and other parameters were determined. MCFA do not lead to a significant elevation of postprandial total plasma triglycerides and other triglyceride parameters, while both SFA (patients: p = 0.003, controls: p = 0.03 compared to MCFA) and MUFA (patients: p = 0.001; controls: p = 0.14 compared to MCFA) do lead to such an increase. Patients experienced a significantly more pronounced increase of plasma triglycerides than controls (SFA: patients iAUC = 1006 mg*h/dL, controls iAUC = 247 mg*h/dL, p = 0.02; MUFA: patients iAUC = 962 mg*h/dL, controls iAUC = 248 mg*h/dL, p = 0.05).

Acute effects of dietary fatty acids on osteclastogenesis via RANKL/RANK/OPG system.,Naranjo MC; Garcia I; Bermudez B; Lopez S; Cardelo MP; Abia R; Muriana FJ; Montserrat-de la Paz S,"SCOPE: Postprandial state is directly linked with chronic diseases. We hypothesized that dietary fats may have acute effects on health status by modulating osteoclast differentiation and activation in a fatty acid-dependent manner. METHODS AND RESULTS: In healthy subjects, a fat-enriched meal increased plasma levels of the RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand)/OPG (osteoprotegerin) ratio (SFAs > MUFAs = PUFAs) in the postprandial state. Postprandial TRL-SFAs enhanced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and the expression of osteoclast marker genes (TRAP, OSCAR, RANK, and CATHK) while downregulated the expression of OPG gene in human monocyte-derived osteoclasts. These effects were not observed with monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-enriched postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). Moreover, postprandial TRL-SFAs increased the release of osteoclastogenic cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) meanwhile TRL-MUFAs and TRL-PUFAs increased the release of anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the medium of human monocyte-derived osteoclasts. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we show that postprandial TRLs are metabolic entities with osteoclastogenic activity and that this property is related to the type of dietary fatty acid in the meal. The osteoclastogenic potency was as follows: SFAs >>> MUFAs = PUFAs. These exciting findings open opportunities for developing nutritional strategies with olive oil as the principal dietary source of MUFAs, notably oleic acid, to prevent development and progression of osteoclast-related diseases.",2016,Nov,Mol Nutr Food Res,60,11,2505-2513,,10.1002/mnfr.201600303,27339288,#6056,Naranjo 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Combined effect of unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids on the metabolic syndrome: Tehran lipid and glucose study.,Hosseinpour-Niazi S; Mirmiran P; Fallah-ghohroudi A; Azizi F,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the background intakes of total dietary fat, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) modulate the effects of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) on metabolic syndrome (MetS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of 4,677 adults, aged 19 to 84 years. MetS was defined according to the ATP III criteria. RESULTS: Median intakes of SFA, MUFA and PUFA were 9.5, 9.6 and 5.6% of total energy. High SFA intakes were associated with higher prevalence of MetS, in both individuals with higher and lower median intakes of total fat, MUFA and PUFA.

Successful manipulation of the quality and quantity of fat and carbohydrate consumed by free-living individuals using a food exchange model.,Moore C; Gitau R; Goff L; Lewis FJ; Griffin MD; Chatfield MD; Jebb SA; Frost GS; Sanders TA; Griffin BA; Lovegrove JA,"Our objective in this study was to develop and implement an effective intervention strategy to manipulate the amount and composition of dietary fat and carbohydrate (CHO) in free-living individuals in the RISCK study. The study was a randomized, controlled dietary intervention study that was conducted in 720 participants identified as higher risk for or with metabolic syndrome. All followed a 4-wk run-in reference diet [high saturated fatty acids (SF)/high glycemic index (GI)]. Volunteers were randomized to continue this diet for a further 24 wk or to 1 of 4 isoenergetic prescriptions [high monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)/high GI; high MUFA/low GI; low fat (LF)/high GI; and LF/low GI]. We developed a food exchange model to implement each diet. Dietary records and plasma phospholipid fatty acids were used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention strategy. Reported fat intake from the LF diets was significantly reduced to 28% of energy (%E) compared with 38%E from the HM and LF diets. SF intake was successfully decreased in the HM and LF diets to < or =10%E compared with 17%E in the reference diet (P = 0.001). Dietary MUFA in the HM diets was approximately 17%E, significantly higher than in the reference (12%E) and LF diets (10%E) (P = 0.001). Changes in plasma phospholipid fatty acids provided further evidence for the successful manipulation of fat intake. The GI of the HGI and LGI arms differed by approximately 9 points (P = 0.001).

SFAs do not impair endothelial function and arterial stiffness.,Sanders TA; Lewis FJ; Goff LM; Chowienczyk PJ,"BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether saturated fatty acids (SFAs) impair endothelial function and contribute to arterial stiffening. OBJECTIVE: We tested the effects of replacing SFAs with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or carbohydrates on endothelial function and arterial stiffness. DESIGN: With the use of a parallel-designed randomized controlled trial in 121 insulin-resistant men and women, we measured vascular function after 1 mo of consumption of a high-SFA (HS) diet and after 24 wk after random assignment to the HS diet or diets that contained <10% SFAs and were high in either MUFAs or carbohydrates. The primary outcome was a change in flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and secondary outcomes were changes in carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and plasma 8-isoprostane F2α-III concentrations. RESULTS: For 112 participants with data available for analysis on the specified outcomes, no significant differences were shown. FMD with the HS reference diet was 6.7 ± 2.2%, and changes (95% CIs) after 6 mo of intervention were +0.3 (-0.4, 1.1), -0.2 (-0.8, 0.5), and -0.1 (-0.6, 0.7) with HS, high-MUFA (HM), and high-carbohydrate (HC) diets, respectively. After consumption of the HS reference diet, the geometric mean (±SD) PWV was 7.67 ± 1.62 m/s, and mean percentages of changes (95% CIs) were -1.0 (-6.2, 4.3) with the HS diet, 2.7 (-1.4, 6.9) with the HM diet, and -1.0 (-5.5, 3.4) with the HC diet. With the HS reference diet, the geometric mean (±SD) plasma 8-isoprostane F2α-III concentration was 176 ± 85 pmol/L, and mean percentage of changes (95% CIs) were 1 (-12, 14) with the HS diet, 6 (-5, 16) with the HM diet, and 4 (-7, 16) with the HC diet.

Effect of a high monounsaturated fatty acids diet and a Mediterranean diet on serum lipids and insulin sensitivity in adults with mild abdominal obesity.,Bos MB; de Vries JH; Feskens EJ; van Dijk SJ; Hoelen DW; Siebelink E; Heijligenberg R; de Groot LC,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diets high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) such as a Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by improving insulin sensitivity and serum lipids. Besides being high in MUFA, a Mediterranean diet also contains abundant plant foods, moderate wine and low amounts of meat and dairy products, which may also play a role. We compared the effects of a high MUFA-diet with a diet high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and the additional effect of a Mediterranean diet on insulin sensitivity and serum lipids. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized parallel controlled-feeding trial was performed, in 60 non-diabetics (40-65 y) with mild abdominal obesity. After a two week run-in diet high in SFA (19 energy-%), subjects were allocated to a high MUFA-diet (20 energy-%), a Mediterranean diet (MUFA 21 energy-%), or the high SFA-diet, for eight weeks. The high MUFA and the Mediterranean diet did not affect fasting insulin concentrations. The high MUFA-diet reduced total cholesterol (-0.41 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.74, -0.09) and LDL-cholesterol (-0.38 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.65, -0.11) compared with the high SFA-diet, but not triglyceride concentrations. The Mediterranean diet increased HDL-cholesterol concentrations (+0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.0, 0.18) and reduced the ratio of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (-0.39, 95% CI -0.62, -0.16) compared with the high MUFA-diet. CONCLUSION: Replacing a high SFA-diet with a high MUFA or a Mediterranean diet did not affect insulin sensitivity, but improved serum lipids. The Mediterranean diet was most effective, it reduced total and LDL-cholesterol, and also increased HDL-cholesterol and reduced total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio.",2010,Oct,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,20,8,591-8,,10.1016/j.numecd.2009.05.008,19692213,#6070,Bos 2010,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Changes in hemostasis during treatment of hypertriglyceridemia with a diet rich in monounsaturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in comparison with a low-fat diet.,Junker R; Pieke B; Schulte H; Nofer R; Neufeld M; Assmann G; Wahrburg U,"High levels of fibrinogen, factor (F) VIIc, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and plasma viscosity are associated with an increased coronary risk. As positive correlations of these parameters with triglycerides have been shown, the increased coronary risk associated with high levels of triglycerides may be assumed to be due to alterations within the hemostatic system. To reduce the coronary risk to which hypertriglyceridemic patients are exposed, dietary treatment is recommended; the optimal composition of such a diet is, however, a matter of debate. With regard to the effects on hemostasis, we compared in a sequential approach two diets for treatment of 25 nonobese male patients (age, mean+/-S.D., 40.4+/-8.7 years) with fasting triglycerides >2.3 mmol/l. The first diet (high fat) was rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), whereas the second diet (low-fat) was rich in complex carbohydrates and dietary fiber. The high-fat diet induced a significant lowering of FIIc, FIXc, FXc, FVIIc, FVIIa, FXIIa, PAI-1, plasma viscosity, and platelet activity, but led to an increase in fibrinogen, whereas the low-fat diet lowered FXIIc values and induced a nonsignificant decrease in fibrinogen. Probands on this diet had a slightly higher FVIIa and platelet activity than those on the high-fat diet. However, as all changes appeared to be within the normal range of each hemostatic parameter, it remains to be clarified whether the likely beneficial effects of the high-fat diet on most hemostatic factors are outweighed by the small increase in fibrinogen levels.",2001,Mar,Thromb Res,101,5,355-66,,10.1016/s0049-3848(00)00421-7,11297752,#6073,Junker 2001,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The association of hs-CRP with fasting and postprandial plasma lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes is disrupted by dietary monounsaturated fatty acids.,Bozzetto L; De Natale C; Di Capua L; Della Corte G; Patti L; Maione S; Riccardi G; Rivellese AA; Annuzzi G,"The aim of the study was to evaluate whether two dietary approaches recommended for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular prevention-high-MUFA or complex carbohydrates/fiber-differently influence inflammation. A 4-week crossover study in 12 individuals with type 2 diabetes was performed. Fasting and postprandial hs-CRP plasma levels were not significantly different after a high-carbohydrate/high-fiber/low-glycemic index (CHO/fiber) and a high-MUFA diet. Compared with fasting, hs-CRP levels decreased significantly after the MUFA but not after the CHO/fiber meal. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were significantly lower after the CHO/fiber than the MUFA diet. At fasting and postprandially, hs-CRP correlated with triglyceride in whole plasma, chylomicrons, small and large VLDL after the CHO/fiber but not after the MUFA diet. In conclusion, a MUFA-rich diet and a carbohydrate/fiber-rich diet induced similar effects on plasma hs-CRP concentrations. However, these dietary approaches seem to influence hs-CRP levels through different mechanisms. i.e., direct acute postprandial effects by MUFA and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins mediated effects by CHO/fiber.",2013,Apr,Acta Diabetol,50,2,273-6,,10.1007/s00592-011-0318-5,21833777,#6080,Bozzetto 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Association Between Nutrient Patterns and Hypertension Among Adults in the United States: A Population-Based Survey.,Mazidi M; Ofori-Asenso R; George ES; Vatanparast H,"INTRODUCTION: Hypertension (HTN) is a common medical condition associated with many adverse health outcomes. Diet plays a crucial role in the pathology, prevention, and management of HTN. AIM: To identify nutrient patterns (NPs) and to investigate their association with the risk of HTN among adults in the United States (US). METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the US community-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants with data on dietary intake and blood pressure were analyzed. NPs were determined by principal components analysis (PCA). In all the analyses (analysis of covariance and multivariate logistic regression), we accounted for the survey design and sample weights. RESULTS: Overall, 22,184 (4002 hypertensive and 18,182 normotensive) individuals were included. We identified three NPs which explained 50.8% of the variance of the dietary nutrient consumption. There was a graded decrease in the odds of association with HTN by quartiles of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) dietary pattern where the 4th quartile was associated with a 28% (odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.82; p < 0.001) lower odds of HTN compared with the first quartile. The second NP ""high in micronutrients and vitamins"" presented a decreasing trend in the odds of association with HTN with the 4th quartile having a 20% [OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63-0.97; p < 0.001] lower odds of HTN compared with the 1st quartile. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide further evidence on the inverse association between a high intake of minerals, vitamins, and MUFA and the risk of HTN. Further observational studies and clinical trials are needed to better understand the influence of MUFA, vitamins, and mineral consumption on HTN.",2020,Apr,High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,27,2,133-138,,10.1007/s40292-020-00364-3,32185752,#6081,Mazidi 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Monounsaturated fat-rich diet prevents central body fat distribution and decreases postprandial adiponectin expression induced by a carbohydrate-rich diet in insulin-resistant subjects.,Paniagua JA; Gallego de la Sacristana A; Romero I; Vidal-Puig A; Latre JM; Sanchez E; Perez-Martinez P; Lopez-Miranda J; Perez-Jimenez F,"OBJECTIVE: Central obesity is associated with insulin resistance through factors that are not fully understood. We studied the effects of three different isocaloric diets on body fat distribution, insulin sensitivity, and peripheral adiponectin gene expression. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven volunteers, offspring of obese type 2 diabetic patients with abdominal fat deposition, were studied. These subjects were considered insulin resistant as indicated by Matsuda index values <4 after an oral glucose tolerance test, and they maintained A1C <6.5% without therapeutic intervention. All subjects underwent three dietary periods of 28 days each in a crossover design: 1) diet enriched in saturated fat (SAT), 2) diet rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA) (Mediterranean diet), and 3) diet rich in carbohydrates (CHOs). RESULTS: Weight, body composition, and resting energy expenditure remained unchanged during the three sequential dietary periods. Using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry we observed that when patients were fed a CHO-enriched diet, their fat mass was redistributed toward the abdominal depot, whereas periphery fat accumulation decreased compared with isocaloric MUFA-rich and high-SAT diets (ANOVA P < 0.05). Changes in fat deposition were associated with decreased postprandial mRNA adiponectin levels in peripheral adipose tissue and lower insulin sensitivity index values from a frequently sampled insulin-assisted intravenous glucose tolerance test in patients fed a CHO-rich diet compared with a MUFA-rich diet (ANOVA P < 0.05).

"Very low-fat (12%) and high monounsaturated fat (35%) diets do not differentially affect abdominal fat loss in overweight, nondiabetic women.",Clifton PM; Noakes M; Keogh JB,"Studies in women with type 2 diabetes demonstrated adverse effects on body fat distribution of a low-fat diet relative to a high monounsaturated fat diet. We performed a randomized 12-wk parallel design study of two 6000-kJ diets: 35% energy from fat (high monounsaturated fat diet, HIMO), or 12% energy from fat (very low-fat diet, VLF) to determine whether this also occurred in nondiabetic women. Body fat distribution, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and fasting serum lipids were measured at wk 0 and 12 in 62 women (BMI > 27 kg/m(2)). Weight loss (9.5 +/- 2.4 vs. 9.4 +/- 3.4 kg, VLF vs. HIMO) and total fat loss (6.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 6.3 +/- 2.7 kg, VLF vs. HIMO) did not differ in the groups. There was a diet x menopausal status interaction in lean mass changes (P = 0.005) such that in premenopausal women, HIMO produced a lower loss of lean mass than the low-fat diet (0.4 +/- 2.3 vs. 2.9 +/- 2.7 kg, P = 0.006) with the opposite but nonsignificant effect seen in postmenopausal women. There was a greater decrease in total plasma cholesterol in women who consumed VLF compared with those who consumed HIMO (0.82 +/- 0.0.51 vs. 0.50 +/- 0.48 mmol/L, P < 0.001 for time, P < 0.05 for diet effect).

Higher intake of dietary n-3 PUFA and lower MUFA are associated with fewer menopausal symptoms.,Abshirini M; Siassi F; Koohdani F; Qorbani M; Khosravi S; Aslani Z; Pak N; Sotoudeh G,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary fat quality and menopausal symptoms. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study with 393 Iranian postmenopausal women. Dietary intakes and menopausal symptoms were assessed, using a validated food frequency questionnaire and a menopausal rating scale (MRS) questionnaire, respectively. Participants were divided into low and high total MRS and its domain scores. RESULTS: Women in the highest quartiles of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) had higher somatic symptoms compared with women in the lowest quartile (odds ratio [OR] 3.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-9.95). Women in the highest quartiles of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.32-1.05), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.37-1.20), and n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.25-0.97) had lower somatic symptoms compared to the lowest quartiles.

Meal Fatty Acids Have Differential Effects on Postprandial Blood Pressure and Biomarkers of Endothelial Function but Not Vascular Reactivity in Postmenopausal Women in the Randomized Controlled Dietary Intervention and VAScular function (DIVAS)-2 Study.,Rathnayake KM; Weech M; Jackson KG; Lovegrove JA,"BACKGROUND: Elevated postprandial triacylglycerol concentrations, impaired vascular function, and hypertension are important independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in women. However, the effects of meal fat composition on postprandial lipemia and vascular function in postmenopausal women are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of sequential meals rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), or n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on postprandial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD; primary outcome measure), vascular function, and associated CVD risk biomarkers (secondary outcomes) in postmenopausal women. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, crossover, postprandial study was conducted in 32 postmenopausal women [mean ± SEM ages: 58 ± 1 y; mean ± SEM body mass index (in kg/m2): 25.9 ± 0.7]. After fasting overnight, participants consumed high-fat meals at breakfast (0 min; 50 g fat, containing 33-36 g SFAs, MUFAs, or n-6 PUFAs) and lunch (330 min; 30 g fat, containing 19-20 g SFAs, MUFAs, or n-6 PUFAs), on separate occasions. Blood samples were collected before breakfast and regularly after the meals for 480 min, with specific time points selected for measuring vascular function and blood pressure. RESULTS: Postprandial FMD, laser Doppler imaging, and digital volume pulse responses were not different after consuming the test fats. The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for diastolic blood pressure was lower after the MUFA-rich meals than after the SFA-rich meals (mean ± SEM: -2.3 ± 0.3 compared with -1.5 ± 0.3 mm Hg × 450 min × 103; P = 0.009), with a similar trend for systolic blood pressure (P = 0.012). This corresponded to a lower iAUC for the plasma nitrite response after the SFA-rich meals than after the MUFA-rich meals (-1.23 ± 0.7 compared with -0.17 ± 0.4 μmol/L × 420 min P = 0.010). The soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) time-course profile, AUC, and iAUC were lower after the n-6 PUFA-rich meals than after the SFA- and MUFA-rich meals (P ≤ 0.001).

Cluster of differentiation 36 gene polymorphism (rs1761667) is associated with dietary MUFA intake and hypertension in a Japanese population.,Fujii R; Hishida A; Suzuki K; Imaeda N; Goto C; Hamajima N; Wakai K; Kondo T,"Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) is a membrane receptor expressed on a wide variety of human cells. CD36 polymorphisms are reportedly associated with oral fat perception, dietary intake and metabolic disorders. The present study examined associations of two CD36 polymorphisms (rs1761667 and rs1527483) and dietary fat intake, and metabolic phenotypes in a Japanese population. This cross-sectional study was conducted based on clinical information collected from health check-ups in Japan (n 495). Dietary nutrient intake was estimated from a validated short FFQ and adjusted for total energy intake using the residual method. Mean blood pressure was calculated from systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Hypertension was defined as SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 85 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive drugs. Genotyping was performed using PCR with confronting two-pair primers method.

Individuals with the AA genotype showed higher total fat and MUFA intake (standardised β = 0·110 and 0·087, P = 0·01 and 0·05, respectively) compared with the GG and GA genotypes. For metabolic phenotypes, the AA genotype of rs1761667 had a lower blood pressure compared with the GG genotype (standardised β = -0·123, P = 0·02). Our results suggested that the AA genotype of rs1761667 in the CD36 gene was associated with higher intake of total fat and MUFA and lower risk of hypertension in a Japanese population.",2019,Jun,Br J Nutr,121,11,1215-1222,,10.1017/S0007114519000679,30924431,#6093,Fujii 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The Mediterranean-type diet: is there a need for further modification?,Masana L; Camprubi M; Sarda P; Sola R; Joven J; Turner PR,"The effects on plasma lipoproteins of four fat-modified diets were assessed in 11 nuns in a contemplative order in the Mediterranean region of Spain. Diet 1 [high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), low monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), low ratio of PUFAs to saturated fatty acids (P:S)] and diet 3 (low PUFA, high MUFA, low P:S) induced significant, directly comparable reductions in total plasma (12% and 13%, respectively) and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (24% and 19%, respectively). Diet 2 [high PUFA, high MUFA, low saturated fatty acid (SFA), high P:S] induced greater decrements (23% and 30% in total plasma and LDL cholesterol, respectively). Diet 4 (low PUFA, low MUFA, high SFA, low P:S) induced a significant increase in LDL cholesterol of 11%. No significant changes in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were observed with these diets.

Consumption of a high monounsaturated fat diet reduces oxidative phosphorylation gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of abdominally overweight men and women.,van Dijk SJ; Feskens EJ; Bos MB; de Groot LC; de Vries JH; Müller M; Afman LA,"The Mediterranean (MED) diet is often considered health-promoting due to its high content of MUFA and polyphenols. These bioactive compounds can affect gene expression and accordingly may regulate pathways and proteins related to cardiovascular disease prevention. This study aimed to identify the effects of a MED-type diet, and the replacement of SFA with MUFA in a Western-type diet, on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression and plasma proteins. Abdominally overweight men and women (waist: women ≥80 cm, men ≥94 cm) were allocated to an 8-wk, completely controlled SFA diet (19% daily energy as SFA), a MUFA diet (20% daily energy MUFA), or a MED diet (21% daily energy MUFA). Concentrations of 124 plasma proteins and PBMC whole-genome transcriptional profiles were assessed. Consumption of the MUFA and MED diets, compared with the SFA diet, decreased the expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, plasma connective tissue growth factor, and apoB concentrations. Compared with the MED and SFA diets, the MUFA diet changed the expression of genes involved in B-cell receptor signaling and endocytosis signaling. Participants who consumed the MED diet had lower concentrations of proinflammatory proteins at 8 wk compared with baseline. We hypothesize that replacement of SFA with MUFA may improve health, thereby reducing metabolic stress and OXPHOS activity in PBMC. The MED diet may have additional antiatherogenic effects by lowering proinflammatory plasma proteins.",2012,Jul,J Nutr,142,7,1219-25,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00405197,10.3945/jn.111.155283,22623392,#6097,vanDijk 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Influence of dietary fatty acid composition and exercise on changes in fat oxidation from a high-fat diet.,Cooper JA; Watras AC; Shriver T; Adams AK; Schoeller DA,"Acute high-fat (HF) diets can lead to short-term positive fat balances until the body increases fat oxidation to match intake. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a HF diet, rich in either mono-unsaturated or saturated fatty acids (FAs) and exercise, on the rate at which the body adapts to a HF diet.(13)C-labeled oleate and (2)H-labeled palmitate were also given to determine the contribution of exogenous vs. global fat oxidation. Eight healthy men (age of 18-45 yr; body mass index of 22 ± 3 kg/m(2)) were randomized in a 2 × 2 crossover design. The four treatments were a high saturated fat diet with exercise (SE) or sedentary (SS) conditions and a high monounsaturated fat diet with exercise (UE) or sedentary (US) conditions. Subjects stayed for 5 days in a metabolic chamber. All meals were provided. On day 1, 30% of energy intake was from fat, whereas days 2-5 had 50% of energy as fat. Subjects exercised on a stationary cycle at 45% of maximal oxygen uptake for 2 h each day. Respiratory gases and urinary nitrogen were collected to calculate fat oxidation. Change from day 1 to day 5 showed both exercise treatments increased fat oxidation (SE: 76 ± 30 g, P = 0.001; UE: 118 ± 31 g, P < 0.001), whereas neither sedentary condition changed fat oxidation (SS: -10 ± 33 g, P = not significant; US: 41 ± 14 g, P = 0.07).

No effect of saturated fatty acid chain length on meal-induced thermogenesis in overweight men.,Nguo K; Huggins CE; Truby H; Sinclair AJ; Clarke RE; Bonham MP,"Monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids have been shown to induce greater meal-induced thermogenesis (MIT) than saturated fatty acids (SFA) in some studies, however, the effect of SFA chain length has not been examined. We hypothesized that a meal rich in short- to medium-chain SFA would elicit a greater MIT than one rich in long-chain SFA, and that MIT responses would be comparable between the short- to medium-chain SFA and the MUFA rich meal. A 3-arm crossover study was conducted with healthy overweight men, aged 18 to 40 years. Participants consumed either an iso-energetic (3780 ± 4.3 kJ), high fat (45%) meal rich in short-/medium-chain SFA (SMCSFA) (2-12 carbons); long-chain SFA (LCSFA) (14-24 carbons), and MUFA. MIT, fat oxidation, triglyceride and subjective appetite were measured for 6 hours post-prandial. Data were analyzed as total area under the curve and compared using a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA. The mean BMI of participants (n =13) was 29.3 ± 0.6 kg/m(2) and mean age 23.8±1.4 years. MIT was not different between the meals: MUFA (204.2 ± 20.5 kJ/6 h), SMCSFA (192.6 ± 21.8 kJ/6 h), LCSFA (198.1 ± 21.5 kJ/6 h) (P = .888).

Dietary fat intake and quality of life: the SUN project.,Ruano C; Henriquez P; Bes-Rastrollo M; Ruiz-Canela M; del Burgo CL; Sánchez-Villegas A,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have related nutritional factors with quality of life in healthy populations. The purpose of the study was to assess whether dietary fat intake is associated to mental and physical quality of life. METHODS: This analysis included 8,430 participants from the SUN (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra) Project. The intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), trans unsaturated fatty acids (TFA), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was assessed through a 136-item food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Quality of life was measured with the SF-36 Health Survey after 4 years of follow-up. Generalized Linear Models were fitted to assess the regression coefficients (b) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the 8 domains of the SF-36 according to successive quintiles of each kind of fatty acids intake. RESULTS: The multivariate-adjusted models revealed a significant inverse association for SFA intake (in quintiles) and two of the physical domains (physical functioning and general health). E.g. for general health domain: (highest quintile of intake (Q5) vs. lowest quintile (Q1), b = -1.6; 95% CI = -3.1, -0.1. General health also showed a dose-response relationship (p for trend < 0.05). For TFA intake (in quintiles), a significant inverse association was found for most of the mental domains (vitality, social functioning and role emotional). E.g. for vitality domain (Q5) vs. (Q1), b = -2.0, 95% CI = -3.4 to -0.6. We also found an inverse association between TFA intake and the bodily pain domain: (Q5 vs. Q1), b = -2.6; 95% CI = -4.4 to -0.8, with a statistically significant dose-response relationship (p for trend < 0.05). Except for TFA intake and the mental domains, the rest of the associations were attenuated when we repeated the analysis adjusting for adherence to the Mediterranean diet.

Effects of dietary fatty acid composition from a high fat meal on satiety.,Kozimor A; Chang H; Cooper JA,"The composition of fats within a high-fat (HF) meal may differentially affect hunger and satiety. PURPOSE: Compare HF meals rich in either monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), or saturated fatty acids (SFAs) on the satiety hormone, peptide YY (PYY), and subjective feelings of hunger and fullness. METHODS: Fifteen normal weight women (18-45 year) were randomized in a crossover design to complete three study visits. The three treatments (three visits) were HF meals (70% of energy from fat) rich in MUFAs (42% of total energy), PUFAs (42% of total energy), or SFAs (45% of total energy). At each visit, subjects consumed a HF meal and eight blood draws were collected over a 5 h period. A visual analog scale (VAS) was completed at the same time as each blood draw for subjective feelings of hunger and fullness. RESULTS: The postprandial PYY response (area under the curve) was significantly lower (p<0.05) for the MUFA-rich meal (MUFA: 534.5±27.2 pg/mL/5 h) vs. the SFA-rich or PUFA-rich meals (SFA: 607.3±51.6 pg/mL/5h, PUFA: 633.1±35.8 pg/mL/5 h). The SFA-rich meal elicited greater subjective feelings of fullness compared to MUFA- and PUFA-rich meals (288.1±9.6 vs. 236.8±7.9 and 220.9±7.4 mm/5 h; p=0.04, for 5h AUC for SFA, MUFA, and PUFA, respectively). The only significant correlations between PYY levels and VAS measures were found with the SFA-rich meal. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that liquid meals rich in MUFAs may elicit a weaker satiety response based on PYY levels compared to liquid meals rich in PUFAs or SFAs in normal weight women.",2013,Oct,Appetite,69,,39-45,,10.1016/j.appet.2013.05.006,23688821,#6111,Kozimor 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Avocado (Persea americana) pulp improves cardiovascular and autonomic recovery following submaximal running: a crossover, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial.",Sousa FH; Valenti VE; Pereira LC; Bueno RR; Prates S; Akimoto AN; Kaviani M; Garner DM; Amaral JAT; de Abreu LC,"Previous studies have demonstrated that regular avocado consumption presents advantageous effects on cardiovascular system. However, little attention has been paid to the use of avocado as a dietary supplement, in particular, for individuals involved in physical exercise training. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of acute avocado pulp intake on cardiovascular and autonomic recovery subsequent to moderate exercise. Using a crossover, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial design, 16 healthy female adults underwent two protocols: Avocado pulp (600 mg in capsule) and placebo (600 mg starch in capsule). After the ingestion of Avocado pulp or placebo, the subjects were seated for 60 min at rest, followed by running on a treadmill at a submaximal level and then remained seated for 60 min during recovery from the exercise. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) [rMSSD, SD1, HF (ms(2))] and skin conductance were evaluated before and during exercise, as well as during recovery. HR, systolic blood pressure, HRV and skin conductance recovered faster when subjects were given avocado pulp prior to exercise. In conclusion, avocado pulp improved cardiovascular and autonomic recovery after exercise, suggesting a reduced risk of cardiovascular events after exertion. The current results support the beneficial effects of ingestion of avocado prior to submaximal treadmill running.",2020,Jul,Sci Rep,10,1,10703,,10.1038/s41598-020-67577-3,32612186,#6113,Sousa 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,In database
Postprandial effect of dietary fat quantity and quality on arterial stiffness and wave reflection: a randomised controlled trial.,Lithander FE; Herlihy LK; Walsh DM; Burke E; Crowley V; Mahmud A,"BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is a component of vascular function and an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. There is a lack of conclusive evidence on the effect of a meal rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA) compared with an isoenergetic meal rich in saturated fat (SFA) on postprandial vascular function and specifically on arterial stiffness. METHODS: Twenty healthy, non-smoking males (BMI 24 ± 2 kg/m2; age 37.7 ± 14.4 y) participated in this single-blind, randomised, cross-over dietary intervention study. Each subject was randomised to receive a high-fat test-meal (3 MJ; 56 ± 2 g fat) at breakfast on 2 separate occasions, one rich in oleic acid (MUFA-meal) and one rich in palmitic acid (SFA-meal), and the meals were isoenergetic. Blood pressure (BP), arterial stiffness (PWV) and arterial wave reflection (augmentation index, AIx) were measured using applanation tonometry at baseline and every 30 minutes up to 4 hours after the ingestion of the test-meals. RESULTS: All subjects completed both arms of the dietary intervention. There was no significant difference in BP parameters, PWV or AIx at baseline between the two treatments (P > 0.05). There was a significant increase in brachial and aortic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate and PVW (time, P < 0.05) over the four hours after consumption of the fat-rich test-meal although the increase in PWV was no longer significant when adjusted for the increase in MAP. There was no difference in PWV between the two treatments (treatment*time, P > 0.05). There was a significant reduction in AIx (time, P < 0.05) over the four hour postprandial period although this was no longer significant when adjusted for the increase in heart rate and MAP (time, P > 0.05). There was no difference in AIx between the two treatments (treatment*time, P > 0.05). However, the reduction in heart rate corrected augmentation index (AIx75) was significant when corrected for the increase in MAP (time, P < 0.01) with no differential effect of the treatments (treatment*time, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated a BP dependent increase in PWV and a decrease in arterial wave reflection in the four hour period in response to a high-fat meal. There was no evidence however that replacement of some of the SFA with MUFA had a differential effect on these parameters. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the effects of the substitution of SFA with MUFA on non-serum, new and emerging risk factors for CVD such as arterial stiffness.",2013,Jul,Nutr J,12,,93,,10.1186/1475-2891-12-93,23841960,#6114,Lithander 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of a high monounsaturated fatty acid diet on blood pressure and glucose metabolism in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.,Lauszus FF; Rasmussen OW; Henriksen JE; Klebe JG; Jensen L; Lauszus KS; Hermansen K,"OBJECTIVE: The effect of a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) on blood pressure, glycemic control, lipids and insulin sensitivity was evaluated in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, unpaired diet intervention was performed in 27 women with gestational diabetes mellitus in an outpatient clinic. After randomization the women received either a high-carbohydrate diet (H-CHO) or a high-MUFA diet (H-MUFA) from the 33rd gestational week of pregnancy. Outcome measures were 24 h ambulatory blood pressure, blood lipids, glycemic control and insulin sensitivity estimated by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: The 24 h diastolic blood pressure increased more in the H-CHO group than in the H-MUFA group (P<0.04). CONCLUSIONS: After 5 weeks of treatment with a MUFA-enriched diet, no increase in 24 h diastolic blood pressure and no adverse effects on blood lipids were seen. The favorable effect on the blood pressure by the MUFA diet is a possible non-medication treatment.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of replacing dietary SFAs with MUFAs on concentrations and subclass distributions of VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein, LDL, and HDL and on VLDL apolipoprotein B kinetics. DESIGN: Thirty-five moderately hypercholesterolemic, middle-aged volunteers consumed for 6 wk, in random order, diets containing low (L-MUFA; 7.8% of energy from MUFAs), moderate (M-MUFA; 10.3% from MUFAs), or high (H-MUFA; 13.7% from MUFAs) amounts of MUFAs. Fasting blood samples were taken from all subjects after each intervention. VLDL apolipoprotein B kinetic studies were performed in a subgroup after the L-MUFA and H-MUFA diets. RESULTS: Plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing intakes of dietary MUFAs. This change was entirely accounted for by reduced LDL cholesterol (-0.20 and -0.49 mmol/L after the M-MUFA and H-MUFA diets, respectively, compared with the concentration after the L-MUFA diet; P for trend < 0.01). Plasma triacylglycerol and HDL cholesterol were not significantly affected by the dietary intervention, nor were the concentrations of VLDL(1) (S(f) 60-400), VLDL(2) (S(f) 20-60), or intermediate-density lipoprotein (S(f) 12-20). Production and catabolic rates for VLDL(1) and VLDL(2) were also unaffected. HDL and LDL subclass distributions were not significantly altered, but as a consequence of the overall LDL lowering, concentrations of atherogenic LDL-III were 25% lower after the H-MUFA diet than after the L-MUFA diet (P = 0.02).

High monounsaturated fatty acids intake protects against age-related cognitive decline.,Solfrizzi V; Panza F; Torres F; Mastroianni F; Del Parigi A; Venezia A; Capurso A,"OBJECTIVE: To study the relationships between dietary macronutrient intakes and age-related changes in cognitive functions. METHODS: We investigated these associations in the prevalence survey (1992 through 1993) of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA). The population-based sample of 5,632 subjects of the ILSA, age 65 to 84 years, was identified from the electoral rolls of eight Italian municipalities. In this study, standardized test batteries assessing global cognitive functions (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]), selective attention (Digit Cancellation Test [DCT]), and episodic memory (Babcock Story Recall Test), and a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire evaluating macronutrient energy intakes, were performed on 278 nondemented elderly subjects from the randomized cohort of Casamassima, Bari (n = 704). RESULTS: There was an inverse relationship between monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) energy intake and cognitive decline (MMSE < 24). The effect of education on the odds of having a MMSE score <24 decreased exponentially with the increase of MUFA intakes (over 2,400 kJ; odds ratio, 0.69). Moreover, a significant inverse association was observed between MUFA intakes and DCT score (odds ratio, 0.99). No association was found between nutritional variables and episodic memory.

Substrate oxidation and 24-h EE were measured by whole-body indirect calorimetry. The first measurement (0 mo) was taken during the weight-stabilizing diet, and the second measurement was taken after the 6-mo intervention. RESULTS: A tendency was seen toward a lower 24-h EE with the MUFA than with the LF diet (P = 0.0675), but this trend did not remain after adjustment for the initial loses of fat mass and fat-free mass (P = 0.2963). Meal-induced thermogenesis was significantly (P < 0.05) lower with the MUFA than with the LF diet, but no time x treatment interaction was found. A significant (P = 0.0456) treatment x time interaction was found for spontaneous physical activity. CONCLUSION: Despite a slightly lower meal-induced thermogenesis, the MUFA diet had an effect on 24-h EE that was not significantly different from that of the LF diet after a 6-mo controlled dietary intervention.",2007,Apr,Am J Clin Nutr,85,4,1014-22,,10.1093/ajcn/85.4.1014,17413100,#6135,Rasmussen 2007,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of antioxidants alone and in combination with monounsaturated fatty acid-enriched diets on lipoprotein oxidation.,Reaven P; Grasse B; Barnett J,"Previous studies have demonstrated that compared with more buoyant LDL, dense LDL (D-LDL) is more susceptible to oxidation and less readily protected from oxidation by antioxidant enrichment. However, diets enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) appear particularly effective in protecting D-LDL from oxidation. We therefore evaluated in 12 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus subjects the effects of supplementation with alpha-tocopherol (1600 IU/d) and probucol (1 g/d) alone and in combination with an MUFA-enriched diet on LDL and LDL subfraction susceptibility to oxidation and monocyte release of superoxide anion. Subjects received either alpha-tocopherol or probucol for 4 months, and during the fourth month both groups also received an MUFA-enriched diet. alpha-Tocopherol levels were significantly increased in LDL and LDL subfractions (P < .05) after 3 months of supplementation. MUFA-enriched diets led to further increases in alpha-tocopherol in LDL fractions in the alpha-tocopherol group as well as in those receiving probucol. In the alpha-tocopherol-supplemented group, lag times were increased significantly (1.6- to 2.0-fold) for all LDL fractions, although the absolute increase was least for D-LDL. Although probucol supplementation increased lag times of LDL and LDL subfractions three- to fourfold, D-LDL was still more readily oxidized. In both the alpha-tocopherol- and probucol-supplemented groups the benefit of adding MUFA-enriched diets was greatest for D-LDL, with further increases in lag time of 26% and 18%, respectively. Neither antioxidant supplementation nor the addition of an MUFA-enriched diet reduced unstimulated or phorbol ester-stimulated monocyte superoxide anion production. These data demonstrate the markedly different effects that antioxidants and diet may have on different LDL subfractions, which may be particularly important in individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who frequently have increased amounts of D-LDL.",1996,Dec,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,16,12,1465-72,,10.1161/01.atv.16.12.1465,8977450,#6137,Reaven 1996,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
A nested case-control study on dietary fat consumption and the risk for gallstone disease.,Compagnucci AB; Perroud HA; Batallés SM; Villavicencio R; Brasca A; Berli D; Pezzotto SM,"BACKGROUND: Gallstone disease (GD) incidence and prevalence rates differ between populations. Diet and lifestyle may be involved in GD development. To our knowledge, no study to date has evaluated quantitative data on diet when studying the relationship between fat consumption levels and GD in an Argentinean population. The present study aimed to assess the association between dietary fat intake and GD. METHODS: A nested case-control study design was applied. Data were taken from subjects who participated in a previous cross-sectional study carried out in a random sample of asymptomatic people in Rosario, Argentina. Participants underwent a personal interview, and current weight and height, ancestor's ethnicity, and socio-economic status were recorded. Applying a food-frequency questionnaire and a food photography atlas, quantitative dietary data were estimated by combining the intake frequency, portion size and food composition. Logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted by age, sex, ancestor's ethnicity, body mass index and daily total energy intake as potential confounders. RESULTS: In total, 114 patients were studied (49 cases and 65 controls), without any statistically significant differences for age, sex, socio-economic status, body mass index and ancestry. The mean energy intake was higher in cases than in controls, and significant differences were found for dietary fat consumption. Obese or overweight people have a higher GD risk than subjects with normal weight. Increased GD risks were associated with high intakes of energy, total fat, and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, total fat, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids high intakes are associated with increased GD risk.",2016,Jun,J Hum Nutr Diet,29,3,338-44,,10.1111/jhn.12332,26249795,#6139,Compagnucci 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of a diet higher in carbohydrate/lower in fat versus lower in carbohydrate/higher in monounsaturated fat on postmeal triglyceride concentrations and other cardiovascular risk factors in type 1 diabetes.,Strychar I; Cohn JS; Renier G; Rivard M; Aris-Jilwan N; Beauregard H; Meltzer S; Bélanger A; Dumas R; Ishac A; Radwan F; Yale JF,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a eucaloric diet higher in carbohydrate/lower in fat versus lower in carbohydrate/higher in monounsaturated fat on postmeal triglyceride (TG) concentrations and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in nonobese subjects with type 1 diabetes and in good glycemic control.

Diet-induced change in fatty acid composition of plasma triacylglycerols is not associated with change in glucagon-like peptide 1 or insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes.,Brynes AE; Edwards CM; Jadhav A; Ghatei MA; Bloom SR; Frost GS,"BACKGROUND: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) have been shown to positively affect blood lipids; however, their comparative effects on insulin sensitivity are unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate whether chronic intake of MUFAs or PUFAs improves insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes via stimulation of the endogenous gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 [7-36] amide (GLP-1). DESIGN: Nine overweight people with type 2 diabetes received isoenergetic high-MUFA (20.3 +/- 3.5% of total energy) or high-PUFA (13.4 +/- 1. 3%) diets for 24 d in a randomized, double-blind crossover design. RESULTS: Weight and glycemic control remained stable throughout the study. Despite a significant change in the plasma triacylglycerol linoleic-oleic acid ratio (L:O) with both diets (MUFA: from 0.46 +/- 0.03 to 0.29 +/- 0.02, P: < 0.005; PUFA: from 0.36 +/- 0.04 to 0.56 +/- 0.05, P: < 0.05) and the phospholipid L:O (1.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.0 +/- 0.3; P: = 0.04) during consumption of the PUFA diet, this change was not associated with a change in insulin sensitivity, measured by the short-insulin-tolerance test. There was a significant reduction in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol during consumption of the PUFA diet (5.2 +/- 0.4 compared with 4.7 +/- 0.3; P: = 0.005) but no change with the MUFA diet. There was no change in the fasting or postprandial incremental area under the curve in response to an identical standard test meal for glucose, insulin, triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, or GLP-1. CONCLUSIONS: Over the 3-wk intervention period, diet-induced change in the triacylglycerol or phospholipid L:O was not associated with either increased stimulation of GLP-1 or a change in insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes.",2000,Nov,Am J Clin Nutr,72,5,1111-8,,10.1093/ajcn/72.5.1111,11063437,#6146,Brynes 2000,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of dietary monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids on the susceptibility of plasma low density lipoproteins to oxidative modification.,Bonanome A; Pagnan A; Biffanti S; Opportuno A; Sorgato F; Dorella M; Maiorino M; Ursini F,"Oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDLs) are thought to play an important role in atherogenesis. Nutritional and biochemical studies suggest that diet can modulate the susceptibility of plasma LDL to undergo oxidative degradation by affecting the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants in the lipoprotein particle. In the present study 11 healthy male volunteers underwent two diet phases. In one phase the diet was enriched in oleic acid (mono), while in the other it was high in linoleic acid (poly). Both diets lowered plasma total and LDL cholesterol contents. The sensitivity of plasma LDL to oxidation was estimated by challenging these lipoproteins with 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride, a free-radical initiator. Although neither diet affected the antioxidant content of plasma LDL, the resistance to lipid peroxidation, measured after the consumption of antioxidants present in the lipoprotein, was higher during the mono phase. Indeed, the peroxidation rate of plasma LDL was inversely correlated with the oleic acid to linoleic acid ratio in the LDL particle. These results support the thesis that diets rich in monounsaturated fatty acids increase the resistance of plasma LDL to oxidative modification, independent of their content of antioxidants. This effect could lower the atherogenicity of these lipoproteins.",1992,Apr,Arterioscler Thromb,12,4,529-33,,10.1161/01.atv.12.4.529,1558840,#6147,Bonanome 1992,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Poly is more effective than monounsaturated fat for dietary management in the metabolic syndrome: The muffin study.,Miller M; Sorkin JD; Mastella L; Sutherland A; Rhyne J; Donnelly P; Simpson K; Goldberg AP,"BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent and associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lifestyle recommendations to treat MetS often include the replacement of saturated fats (SFAs) and monosaccharides with unsaturated fat. However, it is unclear whether metabolic parameters will improve more when the saturated fat in American Heart Association (AHA) diets is replaced with higher concentrations of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA or PUFA). OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that an AHA diet enriched in MUFA improves lipoprotein lipids, insulin resistance, inflammation, and endothelial function to a greater extent than a diet enriched in PUFA in middle-aged men and women with MetS. METHODS: A prospective, open-label, parallel group design with randomization to a hypocaloric MUFA or PUFA-enriched diet after weight stabilization on an AHA step I diet. Participants consumed 3 MUFA-enriched or PUFA-enriched muffins daily with additional supplementation as required to ensure 25%-50% increases in dietary fat intake from these sources at the expense of SFA and the opposing unsaturated fat. Changes in MetS components were measured at baseline and after 6 months of dietary intervention. RESULTS: Thirty-nine participants (mean age, 60.8 years; 79% African-American, 60% women) with MetS completed the 6-month study. Compared to baseline, assignment to either MUFA (n = 23) or PUFA (n = 16) both were associated with weight loss (MUFA: -2.3 ± 1 kg, P = .06; PUFA: -4.6 ± 2 kg; P = .002), but PUFA was also associated with reductions in triglycerides (TG) (-30 ± 18 mg/dL, P = .02), systolic blood pressure (BP) (-7 ± 3 mm Hg, P = .01), diastolic BP (DBP) (-4 ± 2 mm Hg, P = .01) and improved flow mediated dilation (FMD) (7.1% ± 1.8% vs 13.6% ± 2%, absolute increase; P = .0001). When compared to MUFA treatment, PUFA intervention was associated with reduced TG (P = .04) and DBP (P = .07) as well as increased FMD (P = .04) even after adjustment for changes in weight. There was no effect on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), or other inflammatory proteins. Overall, 25% (4 of 16) assigned to PUFA and 13% (3 of 23) to MUFA converted to non-MetS status. CONCLUSION: Substitution of SFA with PUFA in patients with MetS is associated with greater reductions in TG and improvement in endothelial function than MUFA that is independent of weight loss. These preliminary findings raise the possibility that PUFA may be the unsaturated fat of choice to reduce cardiometabolic risk in patients with MetS.",2016,Jul-Aug,J Clin Lipidol,10,4,996-1003,,10.1016/j.jacl.2016.04.011,27578132,#6149,Miller 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Substitution of saturated with monounsaturated fat in a 4-week diet affects body weight and composition of overweight and obese men.,Piers LS; Walker KZ; Stoney RM; Soares MJ; O'Dea K,"A randomised crossover study of eight overweight or obese men (aged 24-49 years, BMI 25.5-31.3 kg/m(2)), who followed two diets for 4 weeks each, was performed to determine whether substitution of saturated fat with monounsaturated fat affects body weight and composition. Subjects were provided with all food and beverages as modules (selected ad libitum) of constant macronutrient composition, but differing energy content. The % total energy from saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat was 24, 13 and 3 % respectively on the saturated fatty acid (SFA)-rich diet and 11, 22 and 7 % respectively on the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diet. MUFA accounted for about 80 % of the unsaturated fats consumed on both diets. Body composition, blood pressure, energy expenditure (resting and postprandial metabolic rates, substrate oxidation rate, physical activity), serum lipids, the fatty acid profile of serum cholesteryl esters and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured before and after each diet period. Significant (P< or =0.05) differences in total cholesterol and the fatty acid composition of serum cholesteryl esters provided evidence of dietary adherence. The men had a lower weight (-2.1 (SE 0.4) kg, P=0.0015) and fat mass (-2.6 (SE 0.6) kg, P=0.0034) at the end of the MUFA-rich diet as compared with values at the end of the SFA-rich diet. No significant differences were detected in energy or fat intake, energy expenditure, substrate oxidation rates or self-reported physical activity. Substituting dietary saturated with unsaturated fat, predominantly MUFA, can induce a small but significant loss of body weight and fat mass without a significant change in total energy or fat intake.",2003,Sep,Br J Nutr,90,3,717-27,,10.1079/bjn2003948,13129479,#6156,Piers 2003,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Dietary intake of unsaturated fatty acids and age-related cognitive decline: a 8.5-year follow-up of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging.,Solfrizzi V; Colacicco AM; D'Introno A; Capurso C; Torres F; Rizzo C; Capurso A; Panza F,"There is evidence from a population-based study of an inverse relationship between monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) energy intake and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD), while high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake was positively associated with cognitive impairment in elderly subjects.

Apolipoprotein E enrichment of immuno-separated chylomicron and chylomicron remnants following saturated fatty acids.,Jackson KG; Wolstencroft EJ; Bateman PA; Yaqoob P; Williams CM,"AIM: We examined the effect of meal fatty acids on lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron/chylomicron remnants in lipid fractions with a Svedberg flotation rate (Sf) 60-400 and Sf 20-60. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six healthy middle-aged men received in random order mixed meals enriched with saturated (SFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) or monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids on 3 occasions. VLDL and chylomicron/chylomicron remnants in the lipid fractions were separated by immunoaffinity chromatography against apo B-100. In the Sf 60-400 chylomicron/chylomicron remnants, triacylglycerol and cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower following PUFA compared with SFA and MUFA (P < or = 0.05). Apolipoprotein (apo) E responses were significantly higher after SFA in chylomicron/chylomicron remnants and VLDL compared with PUFA and MUFA (P < 0.007). However, apo B responses (particle number) were higher following MUFA than SFA (P = 0.039 for chylomicron/chylomicron remnants). Composition of the chylomicron/chylomicron remnants (expressed per particle) revealed differences in their triacylglycerol and apo E contents; in the Sf 60-400 fraction, SFA-rich chylomicron/chylomicron remnants contained significantly more triacylglycerol than MUFA (P = 0.028), more apo E than PUFA- and MUFA-rich particles (P < 0.05) and in the Sf 20-60 fraction, more apo E than MUFA (P = 0.009).

Effect of a monounsaturated diet vs. a polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched diet on blood pressure in normotensive women and men.,Mensink RP; Stolwijk AM; Katan MB,"The effect on blood pressure of monounsaturated and (n-6)polyunsaturated fatty acids was studied under strict dietary control in normotensive subjects. For 17 days 31 women and 27 men received a control diet providing 19.3% of energy as saturated fat. Then subjects were randomized over two test diets: one diet provided 15.1% of energy from monounsaturated and 7.9% from polyunsaturated fatty acids ('mono diet'), and the other diet provided 10.8% from monounsaturated and 12.7% from polyunsaturated fatty acids ('poly diet'). Saturated fat intake was now 12.8% on both diets. Mean blood pressure at the end of the control period was 116/69 mmHg for the mono group and 117/73 mmHg for the poly group. After 5 weeks on the test diet, blood pressure was 115/67 mmHg for the mono group and 117/72 mmHg for the poly group (difference in changes between the two diet groups was not significant). These findings suggest that at a high fat intake, linoleic acid, when providing more than 7.9% of energy intake, does not influence blood pressure relative to oleic acid in normotensive women and men.",1990,Aug,Eur J Clin Invest,20,4,463-9,,10.1111/j.1365-2362.1990.tb01885.x,2121507,#6164,Mensink 1990,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of an Avocado-based Mediterranean Diet on Serum Lipids for Secondary Prevention after Ischemic Stroke Trial (ADD-SPISE): Study protocol.,Olavarría VV; Campodónico P; Vollrath V; von Geldern P; Velásquez C; Pavez P; Valente B; Donoso P; Ginesta A; Cavada G; Mazzon E; Navia V; Guzmán M; Brinck P; Lavados PM,"BACKGROUND: A poor or unhealthy diet is responsible for an important fraction of ischemic stroke risk. Adherence to dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, rich in monounsaturated fatty acids mainly from olive oil, is associated with a lower stroke risk. Furthermore, lowering low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreases stroke recurrence. Interestingly, Avocado-substituted diets, which are also rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, significantly decrease LDL cholesterol levels. This study aims to evaluate whether a Mediterranean diet based on Avocados reduces LDL-C compared to a low-fat high-complex carbohydrate diet after 3 months of the intervention in patients who had a recent acute ischemic stroke. The trial will also assess safety and feasibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, randomized open-label, blinded outcome assessment clinical trial. Participants are patients within a month of being admitted with an ischemic stroke, who consent and fulfil the eligibility criteria. Patients are randomly assigned to either diet intervention in a 1:1 ratio on top of the usual secondary prevention treatment. The intervention diet is: A).. Avocado-based Mediterranean diet with intake of 1/2 portion of Avocado per day and B).. The control diet is a low-fat high-complex carbohydrate diet. The main efficacy outcome is a reduction in plasma LDL-C levels at 3 months of the dietary intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes in the levels of serum lipid profile and serum inflammation markers, safety, and feasibility. A sample size of 200 patients was estimated to provide 80% power and 5% level of significance (10% loss and 5% crossover) to detect a minimum difference of 4.6 mg/dL in LDL-C after 3 months of intervention. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that an Avocado-based Mediterranean diet will further reduce the levels of LDL-cholesterol at 3 months compared to the control diet, and that the intervention is safe and feasible.

Comparative effects of a recommended lipid-lowering diet vs a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids on serum lipid profiles in healthy young adults.,Wahrburg U; Martin H; Sandkamp M; Schulte H; Assmann G,"This crossover study investigated the effects of two fat-reduced diets, one rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), the other rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), on serum lipid profiles in 38 healthy young adults initially on a typical western diet. After being randomly assigned to two groups, the subjects received the MUFA or PUFA diet for 3-wk and then the other diet for 3 wk. Both test diets led to significant reductions in serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (P less than 0.001). Both reduced apolipoprotein B (P less than 0.001) and apolipoprotein A-I concentrations (P less than 0.01 for the MUFA, P less than 0.001 for the PUFA diet). Apolipoprotein A-I was significantly higher on the MUFA than on the PUFA diet. The ratio of apolipoprotein A-I to B significantly increased on both diets. Thus, a low-fat, MUFA-rich diet is as effective as a low-fat, PUFA-rich diet in lowering total and LDL cholesterol, but both also lowered HDL cholesterol concentrations. The MUFA-rich diet may be more advantageous than the PUFA-rich one because it does not lower apolipoprotein A-I concentrations as much as the PUFA-rich diet.",1992,Oct,Am J Clin Nutr,56,4,678-83,,10.1093/ajcn/56.4.678,1414967,#6174,Wahrburg 1992,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

Effect of a high-carbohydrate versus a high--cis-monounsaturated fat diet on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes.,Shah M; Adams-Huet B; Bantle JP; Henry RR; Griver KA; Raatz SK; Brinkley LJ; Reaven GM; Garg A,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether blood pressure is different in type 2 diabetic patients on a diet rich in carbohydrates versus a diet rich in cis-monounsaturated fatty acids. Data on the dietary effects on these diets' glucose and lipid metabolism have been previously published. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study compared the effect of feeding 42 type 2 diabetic patients a carefully controlled isoenergic high-carbohydrate (high-carb; 55% energy as carbohydrate, 30% as fat, and 10% as monounsaturated fat) and high-monounsaturated fat (high-mono; 45% energy as fat, 25% as monounsaturated fat, and 40% as carbohydrate) diet for 6 weeks each in a four-center, randomized, cross-over study on blood pressure. Twenty-one patients continued the diet they received during the second phase for an additional 8 weeks. RESULTS: According to repeated-measures ANOVA, blood pressure during the last 3 days of each phase was similar after 6 weeks of the high-carb and high-mono diets (systolic blood pressure: 128 +/- 16 vs. 127 +/- 15 mmHg, P = 0.9; diastolic blood pressure: 75 +/- 7 vs. 75 +/- 8 mmHg, P = 0.7). However, after 14 weeks of the high-carb diet (n = 13), there was a significant increase in blood pressure compared with 6 weeks of the high-mono diet (systolic blood pressure: 132 +/- 13 vs. 126 +/- 11 mmHg, P = 0.04; diastolic blood pressure: 83 +/- 6 vs. 76 +/- 7 mmHg, P = 0.002).

Effects of diets rich in monounsaturated fatty acids on plasma lipoproteins--the Jerusalem Nutrition Study: high MUFAs vs high PUFAs.,Berry EM; Eisenberg S; Haratz D; Friedlander Y; Norman Y; Kaufmann NA; Stein Y,"Twenty-six Yeshiva students were randomly assigned to a 24-wk crossover study of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) vs polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) diets (50% carbohydrate, 32% fat, 18% protein) fed alternately during two 12-wk periods. Total plasma cholesterol (TC) decreased significantly by approximately 10% and approximately 16% on the MUFA and PUFA diets, respectively. Plasma triglyceride response was variable. Low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased in both groups with an additional significant effect between periods. Concentrations of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol did not change significantly. LDL-receptor status in fresh monocytes, affinity of LDL towards the LDL receptor in cultured fibroblasts, zonal-centrifugation profiles, and lipoprotein composition were not significantly different between the diets. There was a significantly higher tendency toward lipid peroxidation on the PUFA diet, as ascertained by more thiobarbituric acid-reactive-substances formation on that diet.

Effects of diets rich in monounsaturated fatty acids on plasma lipoproteins--the Jerusalem Nutrition Study. II. Monounsaturated fatty acids vs carbohydrates.,Berry EM; Eisenberg S; Friedlander Y; Harats D; Kaufmann NA; Norman Y; Stein Y,"Seventeen male Yeshiva students were randomly allocated to a crossover study with two 12-wk dietary periods of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) vs a carbohydrate (CHO)-rich diet while concentrations of saturated (SFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids were kept similar. Total plasma cholesterol (TC) decreased significantly by approximately 7.7% and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 14.4% on the MUFA diet, whereas on the CHO diet no significant change in cholesterol concentrations occurred, in contrast to that predicted by the equations of Keys and Hegsted. Concentrations of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) did not change significantly on either diet. On the MUFA diet there was a significantly lower proneness to peroxidation of plasma and LDL lipids and less extensive metabolism of conditioned LDL by peritoneal macrophages. We conclude that dietary MUFAs lower TC and LDL-C concentrations, independently of other dietary fatty acids and in addition may reduce the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative stress.",1992,Aug,Am J Clin Nutr,56,2,394-403,,10.1093/ajcn/56.2.394,1636617,#6183,Berry 1992,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,In database
"Site-specific differences in the fatty acid composition of abdominal adipose tissue in an obese population from a Mediterranean area: relation with dietary fatty acids, plasma lipid profile, serum insulin, and central obesity.",Garaulet M; Pérez-Llamas F; Pérez-Ayala M; Martínez P; de Medina FS; Tebar FJ; Zamora S,"BACKGROUND: Abdominal obesity is associated with coronary risk, although causality is not well established. OBJECTIVE: In an obese Mediterranean population, we measured the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue, its relation with dietary fatty acids and central fat deposition, and its influence on plasma lipids and insulin. DESIGN: Adipose tissue samples were obtained from 84 obese patients (29 men, 55 women) aged 30-70 y (body mass index, in kg/m(2): 27-35). We measured concentrations of insulin and lipids in plasma and fatty acids in subcutaneous, omental, and perivisceral fat. Dietary fatty acid intake was assessed with a 7-d diet record. RESULTS: The population studied was normolipidemic and normoinsulinemic. There were important differences in fatty acid composition between tissue sites: saturated fatty acids were higher and monounsaturated fatty acids were lower in perivisceral than in subcutaneous fat (P < 0.05). Significant correlations were found for oleic, linoleic, alpha-linolenic, and total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids between the subject's habitual diet and adipose tissue composition. Oleic and n-3 fatty acids from adipose regions were negatively correlated with apolipoprotein B and triacylglycerols; adipose tissue 22:1n-9, 20:2n-6, stearic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid were positively correlated with HDL and apolipoprotein A; and adipose tissue myristic acid was negatively correlated with apolipoprotein A (P < 0.05). Central obesity was positively associated with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and inversely associated with monounsaturated fatty acids and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue (P < 0.05).

Gender influence on plasma triacylglycerol response to meals with different monounsaturated and saturated fatty acid content.,Koutsari C; Zagana A; Tzoras I; Sidossis LS; Matalas AL,"OBJECTIVE: Both gender and meal fatty acid composition modulate postprandial triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism, but little information exists on their interaction. We compared postprandial TAG concentrations in men and women after test meals differing in the proportion of monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA). SUBJECTS: Nine men (body mass index, BMI: 24.5+/-2.3 kg/m(2)) (mean+/-s.d.) and 10 premenopausal women (BMI: 21.2+/-1.7 kg/m(2)), young and healthy, habituated to a relatively high MUFA diet. DESIGN: Plasma responses were studied after subjects consumed two meals, each providing 60 g of fat and 4.7 MJ, on different occasions: one meal was rich in MUFA (MUFA meal: 40 g MUFA; 12 g SFA) and the other meal was rich in SFA (SFA meal: 20 g MUFA; 32 g SFA). The total body and abdominal fat mass were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Fasting plasma TAG concentration did not differ between meals or genders. No gender differences were observed in either total body or abdominal fat mass. The area under the plasma concentration vs time curve was on average 60% higher (P<0.001) in men than women. Repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of meal x time interaction in men (P<0.001) but not in women (P=0.84). In men, maximal plasma TAG occurred at 4 h and was significantly greater after the MUFA meal (2.10+/-0.20 mmol/l) (mean+/-s.e.m.) than after the SFA meal (1.66+/-0.19 mmol/l) (P=0.01). TAG concentration at 5 h was also significantly greater after the MUFA meal. In women, the patterns of TAG responses were identical after the MUFA and SFA meals.

[The diet rich in monounsaturated fat modifies in a beneficial way carbohydrate metabolism and arterial pressure].,Salas J; López Miranda J; Jansen S; Zambrana JL; Castro P; Paniagua JA; Blanco A; López Segura F; Jiménez Perepérez JA; Pérez Jiménez F,"OBJECTIVE: Two dietary regimens recommended for the reduction of coronary risk, by way of their effects on lipid profile, are the diet low in saturated fat and a diet rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFA). However the effects of these diets on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy subjects are not well known. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of both diets on various parameters of carbohydrate metabolism. METHODS: 41 healthy young males were submitted to 3 consecutive diets, each for a duration of 4 weeks. The first diet was rich in saturated fat (SAT) (38% fat, 20% saturated). The second was rich in carbohydrates following the recommendations of the NCEP-I (National Cholesterol Education Program type I) (28% fat, 47% carbohydrates). The last one was a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (38% fat, 22% MUFA). At the end of each dietary period, blood pressure (BP) and blood levels of glucose, insulin and free fatty acids were determined. 29 subjects were also submitted to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at the end of each diet. RESULTS: The SAT diet induced the highest levels of insulin after the OGTT. The consumption of the MUFA diet determined the lowest levels of fasting blood glucose (-0.60 mmol/l [13%], p < 0.0002), insulin (-9 microUl/ml [47%], p < 0.0002) and free fatty acids (-0.11 mmol/l [24%], p = 0.006), compared to the NCEP-I diet. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher in the NCEP-I diet than during the other periods (SBP: +6 mmHg compare with SAT [5%], p = 0.0001; and +5 mmHg compare with MUFA [4%], p = 0.0001; DBP: +20 mmHg compare with MUFA [27%], p = 0.0001) and +6 mmHg compared with SAT [8%], p = 0.0001).

Influences of apolipoprotein E polymorphism on the response of plasma lipids to the ad libitum consumption of a high-carbohydrate diet compared with a high-monounsaturated fatty acid diet.,Couture P; Archer WR; Lamarche B; Landry N; Dériaz O; Corneau L; Bergeron J; Bergeron N,"The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) polymorphism and factors, such as age and waist circumference, to variations in plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) response following ad libitum consumption of a diet rich in complex carbohydrates (high-CHO: 58% of energy as CHO) versus a diet rich in fat and monounsaturated fatty acids (high-MUFA: fat, 40% of energy and 22% as MUFA). Sixty-five men participated in this parallel 6- to 7-week study involving either a high-CHO or a high-MUFA diet. Fasting plasma lipid profile and anthropometry were determined at the beginning and at the end of the dietary period. The high-CHO and high-MUFA diets both induced significant (P<.01) and comparable reductions in body weight and waist circumference. These changes were associated with a significant (P<.01) and comparable decrease in LDL-C (-19% and -16%, respectively). Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that 32% of the variation in the LDL-C response to the high-CHO diet was attributable to the apoE polymorphism (18.5%, P=.04) and waist circumference (13.5%, P=.03) indicating that men with a waist circumference greater than 100 cm and the E2 allele had the greatest reduction in plasma LDL-C after the high-CHO diet. On the other hand, in the high-MUFA group, waist circumference was the only significant contributing factor to the LDL-C response and accounted for 44.5% of its variance. In conclusion, the plasma LDL-C response to ad libitum comsumption of a high-CHO and a high-MUFA diets are not modulated to the same extent by the apoE polymorphism and waist circumference.",2003,Nov,Metabolism,52,11,1454-9,,10.1016/s0026-0495(03)00275-0,14624406,#6194,Couture 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between quartiles of total fat, mono-unsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) consumption, and all-cause, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and type 2 diabetes (T2D)-associated mortality in 24,144 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999-2010. We added our results to a meta-analysis based on searches until November 2018. RESULTS: In fully adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models in our prospective study, there was an inverse association between total fat (HR: 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.82, 0.99, Q4 vs Q1) and PUFA (0.81, 0.78-0.84) consumption and all-cause mortality, whereas SFA were associated with the increased mortality (1.08, 1.04-1.11).

How the degree of unsaturation of dietary fatty acids influences the glucose and insulin responses to different carbohydrates in mixed meals.,Joannic JL; Auboiron S; Raison J; Basdevant A; Bornet F; Guy-Grand B,"The association of fats with carbohydrates results in a lower glucose response but the influence of the nature of the dietary fatty acids has not been investigated clearly. We examined the effect of the degree of dietary fatty acid unsaturation on the postprandial glucose and insulin responses to a mixed meal. Eight young normolipidemic men consumed four different meals in random order. The meals differed in the nature of their oils and in the type of their main carbohydrates. The meals contained either a high ratio of monounsaturated to polyunsaturated n-6 fatty acids (MUFA) or a low ratio (PUFA) and either potatoes or parboiled rice. Proteins and saturated and polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acid contents were not different among meals. Blood samples were collected every 30 min for 3 h after the test meal. The glucose response was significantly lower 30 min after the parboiled rice-PUFA meal than after parboiled rice-MUFA or potato-MUFA (P < 0.05) meals. The insulin response was lower after parboiled rice-PUFA than after potato-MUFA (P < 0.05) meals. Similarly, an effect of fat appeared after 30 min. Glucose responses (F = 1.4, P < 0.01) and insulin responses (F = 5.3, P < 0.05) to both carbohydrates were significantly lower with dietary PUFA compared with dietary MUFA.

Baseline plasma C-reactive protein concentrations influence lipid and lipoprotein responses to low-fat and high monounsaturated fatty acid diets in healthy men.,Desroches S; Archer WR; Paradis ME; Dériaz O; Couture P; Bergeron J; Bergeron N; Lamarche B,"To date, no studies have compared the effects of consuming a low-fat diet and a high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diet, under unrestricted energy intake conditions, on plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Men [n = 61; 37.5 +/- 11.5 y old (mean +/- SD), mean BMI 29.0 +/- 5.0 kg/m2] were randomly assigned to consume ad libitum a moderately low-fat diet (25.8% of energy intake from fat) or a high-fat diet rich in MUFA (40.1% of energy intake from fat, 22.5% from MUFA) for 6-7 wk. Plasma CRP concentrations were measured using a highly sensitive assay. Neither diet affected the plasma CRP concentration. However, baseline CRP concentrations predicted lipoprotein/lipid responsiveness to the experimental diets. After intake of the low-fat diet, plasma total and VLDL-triglyceride (TG) concentrations were increased in the subgroup with high CRP concentrations (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) whereas they were reduced in the subgroup with low CRP concentrations at baseline (P < 0.01 for both). The high-MUFA diet reduced plasma TG, VLDL-TG, and VLDL cholesterol only in the subgroup with low CRP at baseline (P < 0.0001).

Effects of a multifactorial ecosustainable isocaloric diet on liver fat in patients with type 2 diabetes: randomized clinical trial.,Della Pepa G; Vetrani C; Brancato V; Vitale M; Monti S; Annuzzi G; Lombardi G; Izzo A; Tommasone M; Cipriano P; Clemente G; Mirabelli P; Mancini M; Salvatore M; Riccardi G; Rivellese AA; Bozzetto L,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are still a matter of debate. We compared the effects of a diet including different components versus a proven beneficial diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) on liver fat in T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: According to a parallel design, 49 individuals with T2D, overweight/obese, with high waist circumference, 35-75 years-old, in satisfactory blood glucose control with diet or drugs not affecting liver fat content, were randomly assigned to an 8-week isocaloric intervention with a MUFA diet (n=26) or a multifactorial diet rich in fiber, MUFA, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, and vitamins D, E, and C (n=23). Before and after the intervention, liver fat content was evaluated by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). (1)H-MRS complete data were available for n=21 (MUFA diet) and n=18 (multifactorial diet) participants. RESULTS: Adherence to dietary interventions was optimal. No significant differences between groups in body weight reduction, plasma glycated hemoglobin, insulin, glucose, lipids and liver enzymes were observed. Liver fat significantly decreased after both the multifactorial diet (9.18%±7.78% vs 5.22%±4.80%, p=0.003) and the MUFA diet (9.47%±8.89% vs 8.07%±8.52%, p=0.027) with a statistically significant difference between changes either in absolute terms (-4.0%±4.5% vs -1.4%±2.7%, p=0.035) or percent (-40%±33% vs -19%±25%, p=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: An isocaloric multifactorial diet including several beneficial dietary components induced a clinically relevant reduction of liver fat in patients with T2D, more pronounced than that induced by simply replacing saturated fat with MUFA. This suggests that the 'optimal diet' for NAFLD treatment in T2D should be based on synergic actions of different dietary components on multiple pathophysiological pathways.

METHODS: Between 1995 and 2000, a stratified random sample of 36 034 participants (age range 35-74 years) completed a standardized 24-h dietary recall, assessed by means of the computer software EPIC-SOFT. Lipid intake data were calculated using a standardized nutrient database. RESULTS: On average, the contribution of fat to total energy intake was >or=34% of energy intake (%en) in women and >or=36%en in men for most EPIC centres, except for the British, Dutch and most Italian cohorts. Total fat (>40%en) and MUFA intakes (21%en, mainly from olive oil) were highest in Greece. Except for the Greek, Spanish and Italian centres, the average MUFA intake ranged between 10 and 13%en, with a high proportion derived from animal sources. SFA intake in women and men was lowest in the Greek, Spanish, Italian and UK cohorts with an average of <or=13%en (down to 9%en), and highest in the Swedish centres (16%en). The mean PUFA intake was in the range of 4-8%en, being highest in the UK health-conscious cohort. The average cholesterol intake across EPIC varied from 140 to 384 mg/d in women and 215-583 mg/d in men.

Maternal intake of fat in pregnancy and offspring metabolic health - A prospective study with 20 years of follow-up.,Maslova E; Rytter D; Bech BH; Henriksen TB; Olsen SF; Halldorsson TI,"BACKGROUND: Maternal fat intake during pregnancy in relation to offspring metabolic outcomes has been studied primarily in animal models, yet little is known about the association in humans. The aim of this study was to examine the association of total and subtype of fat consumption in pregnancy with anthropometric measures and biomarkers of adiposity and glucose metabolism in the offspring. METHODS: A source population was 965 Danish pregnant women recruited in 1988-1989 with offspring follow-up at 20 years. Information on fat intake was collected in the 30(th) week of gestation, and we subdivided fat according to saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fat. Offspring body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were recorded at follow-up (n = 670-678), and biomarkers were quantified in a subset (n = 443) of participants. Multivariable linear and log-binomial regression were used to calculate effect estimates and 95% CI for a 1:1%energy substitution of carbohydrates for fat. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) BMI was 22.1 (3.3) and 22.8 (2.9) kg/m(2) in female and male offspring, respectively. The median (10th to 90th percentile) of maternal fat intake was 31% of energy [23,39]. We found no overall associations for maternal fat intake with female offspring anthropometry. However, for male offspring higher intake of MUFA during pregnancy was associated with higher insulin levels at 20 years (Q4 vs. Q1: %Δ: 37, 95% CI: 1, 86) accompanied by a non-significant 3.6 (95% CI: -1.1, 8.2) cm increase in WC. High maternal total fat intake (>=35% energy) was also associated with higher BMI (0.9, 95% CI: 0.2, 1.6) and WC (4.0, 95% CI: 1.6, 2.3) among male offspring. CONCLUSIONS: A high fat diet during pregnancy may increase adiposity in adult male offspring. We surmise that maternal MUFA intake during this time included both MUFA and trans fat misclassified as MUFA, and that the associations observed may be more reflective of the latter exposure.",2016,Apr,Clin Nutr,35,2,475-483,,10.1016/j.clnu.2015.03.018,25933442,#6217,Maslova 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Replacement of dietary saturated with unsaturated fatty acids is associated with beneficial effects on lipidome metabolites: a secondary analysis of a randomized trial.,Sellem L; Eichelmann F; Jackson KG; Wittenbecher C; Schulze MB; Lovegrove JA,"BACKGROUND: The effects of replacing dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and/or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the plasma lipidome in relation to the cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the impact of substituting dietary SFAs with unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) on the plasma lipidome and examine the relationship between lipid metabolites modulated by diet and CMD risk. METHODS: Plasma fatty acid (FA) concentrations among 16 lipid classes (within-class FAs) were measured in a subgroup from the Dietary Intervention and VAScular function (DIVAS) parallel randomized controlled trial (n = 113/195), which consisted of three 16-wk diets enriched in SFAs (target SFA:MUFA:n-6PUFA ratio = 17:11:4% total energy [TE]), MUFAs (9:19:4% TE), or a MUFA/PUFA mixture (9:13:10% TE). Similar lipidomics analyses were conducted in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study (specific case/cohorts: n = 775/1886 for type 2 diabetes [T2D], n = 551/1671 for cardiovascular disease [CVD]). Multiple linear regression and multivariable Cox models identified within-class FAs sensitive to replacement of dietary SFA with UFA in DIVAS and their association with CMD risk in EPIC-Potsdam. Elastic-net regression models identified within-class FAs associated with changes in CMD risk markers post-DIVAS interventions. RESULTS: DIVAS high-UFA interventions reduced plasma within-class FAs associated with a higher CVD risk in EPIC-Potsdam, especially SFA-containing glycerolipids and sphingolipids (e.g., diacylglycerol (20:0) z-score = -1.08; SE = 0.17; P value < 10(-8)), whereas they increased those inversely associated with CVD risk. The results on T2D were less clear. Specific sphingolipids and phospholipids were associated with changes in markers of endothelial function and ambulatory blood pressure, whereas higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were characterized by higher plasma glycerolipids containing lauric and stearic acids. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a mediating role of plasma lipid metabolites in the association between dietary fat and CMD risk. Future research combining interventional and observational findings will further our understanding of the role of dietary fat in CMD etiology.

Association of the fatty acid profile of serum lipids with glucose and insulin metabolism during 2 fat-modified diets in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.,Louheranta AM; Sarkkinen ES; Vidgren HM; Schwab US; Uusitupa MI,"BACKGROUND: Both the amount and quality of dietary fat can modify glucose and insulin metabolism. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between serum lipid fatty acids and glucose metabolism before and after the consumption of a diet enriched in either monounsaturated (Mono diet) or polyunsaturated (Poly diet) fatty acids. DESIGN: After consuming a high-saturated-fat run-in diet for 3 wk, 31 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly counseled to consume the Mono [40% fat; 11%, 19%, and 8% of energy as saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (S:M:P), respectively] or the Poly (34% fat; S:M:P of 11%:10%:10%) diet for 8 wk. Serum lipid fatty acids were measured, and an intravenous-glucose-tolerance test was performed at baseline and at 8 wk. RESULTS: At baseline, a higher glucose effectiveness (S(G)) was associated with higher proportions of oleic (r = 0.57, P = 0.04) and alpha-linolenic (r = 0.64, P = 0.01) acids in phospholipids. An increase in the proportions of oleic and alpha-linolenic acids in phospholipids was associated with a decrease in fasting plasma glucose [r = -0.53 (P = 0.002) and r = -0.47 (P = 0.009), respectively]. An increase in the S(G) was associated with an increase in the proportion of oleic acid (r = 0.55, P = 0.004) and with a decrease in that of arachidonic acid (r = -0.40, P = 0.04) in phospholipids. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial changes in fasting plasma glucose and in the S(G) during the Mono diet were associated with alterations in the proportions of oleic, alpha-linolenic, and arachidonic acids in phospholipids.",2002,Aug,Am J Clin Nutr,76,2,331-7,,10.1093/ajcn/76.2.331,12145003,#6224,Louheranta 2002,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Do colonic short-chain fatty acids contribute to the long-term adaptation of blood lipids in subjects with type 2 diabetes consuming a high-fiber diet?,Wolever TM; Schrade KB; Vogt JA; Tsihlias EB; McBurney MI,"BACKGROUND: We recently obtained evidence of long-term adaptation of blood lipids to changes in intakes of carbohydrate and fiber in subjects with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We determined the effect of increased carbohydrate and fiber intakes on serum short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the relation between changes in serum acetate and changes in blood lipids. DESIGN: Subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 62) were randomly assigned to receive approximately 10% of energy from low-fiber breakfast cereal (LF diet), high-fiber breakfast cereal (HF diet), or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA diet) for 6 mo. RESULTS: Carbohydrate intakes were higher in the LF and HF groups than in the MUFA group (54% compared with 43%), and more fiber was consumed by the HF group (approximately 50 g/d) than by the LF or MUFA group (approximately 23 g/d). Fasting serum SCFAs did not change significantly over the first 3 mo. Between 3 and 6 mo, serum acetate tended (NS) to decrease in the LF group (from 69 +/- 4 to 59 +/- 5 micromol/L) and increase in the HF group (from 100 +/- 18 to 107 +/- 17 micromol/L), with no significant change in the MUFA group. Serum butyrate did not change significantly in the LF or MUFA group but increased in the HF group (from 2.5 +/- 0.5 to 3.1 +/- 0.6 micromol/L; P < 0.001). Changes in serum acetate from 0 to 3 mo were not related to changes in lipids. However, changes in serum acetate from 3 to 6 mo were positively related to changes in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol (P = 0.041) and in fasting (P = 0.013) and postprandial (P = 0.016) triacylglycerols. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with type 2 diabetes, changes in serum SCFAs in response to changes in carbohydrate and fiber intakes took many months to occur, and the changes in serum acetate were significantly related to the long-term adaptive changes in blood lipids.",2002,Jun,Am J Clin Nutr,75,6,1023-30,,10.1093/ajcn/75.6.1023,12036809,#6233,Wolever 2002,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Lack of effect of meal fatty acid composition on postprandial lipid, glucose and insulin responses in men and women aged 50-65 years consuming their habitual diets.",Burdge GC; Powell J; Calder PC,"The aim of the study was to determine the effect of consuming meals with different fatty acid compositions on the postprandial changes over 6 h in plasma triacylglycerol, NEFA, total cholesterol, glucose and insulin concentrations in middle-aged men and women. Men (n 11; 58 (5) years) and women (n 11; 56 (4) years) consumed four test meals with a similar macronutrient energy content in random order: a reference meal based on the habitual pattern of fatty acid intake in the UK, a meal with an increased (155 %) linoleic acid (LA) to alpha-linolenic acid (alphaLNA) ratio (high LA:alphaLNA), a meal with increased (23 %) MUFA content (high MUFA) and a meal with increased (583 %) EPA and DHA content (high EPA+DHA). The high-LA:alphaLNA and high-EPA+DHA meals selectively increased the ratio of LA to alphaLNA (men 341 %; women 310 %) and the EPA+DHA (men 414 %; women 438 %) concentration in plasma triacylglycerol. The high-MUFA meal did not alter the change in MUFA content of the plasma. Plasma triacylglycerol, NEFA, glucose and insulin, but not total cholesterol, concentrations changed significantly after each meal. There was no significant effect of meal fatty acid composition or gender on maximum change in concentration, time to maximum concentration or area under the curve of any of the metabolites measured in the blood. These results suggest that differences in meal fatty acid composition exert little or no effect on postprandial changes in plasma lipids, glucose and insulin concentrations.",2006,Sep,Br J Nutr,96,3,489-500,,,16925854,#6242,Burdge 2006,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Acute effects of dietary fat on inflammatory markers and gene expression in first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetes patients.,Pietraszek A; Gregersen S; Hermansen K,"BACKGROUND: Subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and their relatives (REL) carry an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Low-grade inflammation, an independent risk factor for CVD, is modifiable by diet. Subjects with T2D show elevated postprandial inflammatory responses to fat-rich meals, while information on postprandial inflammation in REL is sparse. AIM: To clarify whether medium-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have differential acute effects on low-grade inflammation in REL compared to controls (CON). METHODS: In randomized order, 17 REL and 17 CON ingested two fat-rich meals, with 72 energy percent from MUFA and 79 energy percent from mainly medium-chain SFA, respectively. Plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin, and leptin were measured at baseline, 15 min, 60 min, and 240 min postprandially. Muscle and adipose tissue biopsies were taken at baseline and 210 min after the test meal, and expression of selected genes was analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma IL-6 increased (p < 0.001) without difference between REL and CON and between the meals, whereas plasma adiponectin and plasma hs-CRP were unchanged during the 240 min observation period. Plasma leptin decreased slightly in response to medium-chain SFA in both groups, and to MUFA in REL. Several genes were differentially regulated in muscle and adipose tissue of REL and CON. CONCLUSIONS: MUFA and medium-chain SFA elicit similar postprandial circulating inflammatory responses in REL and CON. Medium-chain SFA seems more proinflammatory than MUFA, judged by the gene expression in muscle and adipose tissue of REL and CON.",2011,Winter,Rev Diabet Stud,8,4,477-89,,10.1900/RDS.2011.8.477,22580729,#6244,Pietraszek 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Variations in body composition and plasma lipids in response to a high-carbohydrate diet.,Archer WR; Lamarche B; Dériaz O; Landry N; Corneau L; Després JP; Bergeron J; Couture P; Bergeron N,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which variations in body composition modulate changes in the lipid profile in response to the ad libitum consumption of a diet rich in carbohydrates (CHOs) (high-CHO diet: 58% of energy as CHOs) or high in fat and in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (high-MUFA diet: 40% of energy as fat, 23% as MUFAs). RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Sixty-three men were randomly assigned to one of the two diets that they consumed for 6 to 7 weeks. Body composition and fasting plasma lipid levels were measured at the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention. RESULTS: The high-CHO and high-MUFA diets induced significant and comparable reductions in body weight and waist circumference. These changes were accompanied by significant and comparable (p < 0.01) reductions in total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, the high-MUFA diet had more beneficial effects on plasma triglyceride concentrations (p < 0.01) and on plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p = 0.02) compared with the high-CHO diet. Diet-induced changes in waist circumference were significantly associated with changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the high-CHO group (r = 0.39, p = 0.03) but not in the high-MUFA group (r = 0.16, p = 0.38).

[Diets enriched with monounsaturated fatty acids and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decrease blood pressure without changing the plasma insulin concentration in healthy subjects].,Lahoz C; Alonso R; Porres A; Mata P,"BACKGROUND: Plasma glucose, insulin and blood pressure are wellknown cardiovascular risk factors, which may be influence by dietary factors. The aim of the study was to investigate whether changes in dietary fatty acids could modify plasma concentration of glucose, insulin and mean blood pressure (MBP). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty two subjects (18 women and 24 men) were placed in four consecutive five week diet periods. Energy intake from proteins, carbohydrates and fats was constant during the study and there was only changes on fatty acids composition. First period was enriched on saturated fatty acids (SFA), second period on monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and third and fourth periods were enriched on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Fourth period was also enriched on PUFA n-3. RESULTS: No significant changes were found on glucose and insulin plasma concentration. However, a significant effect was detected on MBP on total population (p < 0.0001) and by gender. MUFA and PUFA n-3 enriched diet decreased significantly MBP compared to SFA enriched diet AGS (85.7, SD 9.1, 87.3, SD 8.7 y 90.3, SD 8.8 mmHg, respectively). In addition, a weak (r = 0.28) but significant (p = 0.002) correlation was found between MBP and plasma insulin.

"Influence of fat intake on body composition, lipemia and glycemia of type 1 diabetics.",Mansur Leal P; Lopes Souto D; dos Santos Lima E; Paes de Miranda M; Lopes Rosado E,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and body composition is important in the disease control. The nutritional intervention has relevance in the improvement of glycemia and lipemia in diabetic patients. AIM: Evaluate the influence of fat intake on body composition, lipemia and glycemia on patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: 19 patients were evaluated by anthropometric (body mass index and waist circumference), body composition (fat mass, lean body mass and total body water by bioelectrical impedance) and biochemical variables, after 8 hours of fasting. Dietary assessment was performed using the dietary records for 3 days, analyzed for nutritional software DietPró 5i. The groups were formed according to the usual intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (G1<10% of total energy expenditure (TEE) of SFA and G2≥10% of TEE of SFA). Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS 16.0, considering p<0.05. RESULTS: There was no difference in anthropometric and biochemical variables between groups, but G1 presented higher fat mass (FM) and G2 high SFA and adequate mounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) intake. The lipemia and glycemia were not affected by high SFA intake, but adequate MUFA intake may have influenced the results of these variables. No found relation between type of fat ingested and biochemistry variables. CONCLUSION: Body composition can be influenced by type of fat ingested.

[Carbohydrate and lipid consumption before a training session changed the fat mass in health-physically active adults: a controlled and randomized clinical trial].,Arias Téllez MJ; Carrasco Navarro GN; Plaza Díaz J,"INTRODUCTION: The effect of exercise on fat-acid oxidation depends on its intensity and duration. Pre-training ingest of carbohydrates (CH) decreases the rate of fat oxidation. In contrast, the effect of pre-consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) is less known. OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to compare the effect of pre-consumption of two isocaloric snacks in a standardized exercise session during a period of nine weeks and to quantify their impact in the fat oxidation and decrease of fat mass in healthy and physically active adults. METHODS: randomized, placebo-control clinical trial study. A total of 19 subjects between 20 and 39 years old were randomly distributed in three groups: CH group, with snack of high content of complex CH; FAT group, with snack of high content of MUFA; and control group, with a minimum fast for three hours before the training session. The measurements were rate of fat oxidation, body composition, and endurance training with continuing and intervallic modalities. RESULTS: the control group showed a tendency to fat mass decrease at the end of the intervention. The fat oxidation of group had a higher tendency than the CH and control group, before and after the intervention. Nevertheless, statistical differences of fat oxidation were not found between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: the fat oxidation and the decrease of fat mass may not be influenced by the type of food previously consumed before exercise.",2018,Aug,Nutr Hosp,35,4,936-941,,10.20960/nh.1774,30070885,#6261,AriasTéllez 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Cardiorespiratory fitness modifies the association between dietary fat intake and plasma fatty acids.,König D; Väisänen SB; Bouchard C; Halle M; Lakka TA; Baumstark MW; Alen M; Berg A; Rauramaa R,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relation between (1) cardiorespiratory fitness and plasma saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and (2) the interactions between cardiorespiratory fitness, dietary fat intake and plasma fatty acid composition. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: The subjects were randomly selected, 127 middle-aged Finnish men participating in the DNASCO exercise intervention study. INTERVENTIONS: Cardiorespiratory fitness was determined spiroergometrically, dietary intake of macro- and micronutrients by 4-day food records and plasma fatty acids by gas chromatography. The subjects were divided into tertiles of aerobic fitness. RESULTS: Differences between fitness tertiles were not observed for dietary intake of total fat, and saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids (percent of total energy). In contrast, plasma saturated fatty acids were significantly lower (P <0.01) and polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly higher (P <0.05) in the highest fitness tertile compared to the lowest tertile. Dietary saturated fat intake was positively associated with plasma saturated fatty acids (r=0.342; P <0.05) and inversely with plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids (r=-0.453; P <0.01) only in the lowest fitness tertile. In addition, a positive correlation between body mass index and plasma saturated fatty acids (r=0.516; P <0.01) as well as a negative correlation between body mass index and plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids (r=-0.516; P <0.01) was observed in the lowest tertile solely. CONCLUSION: Different levels in cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with different levels in plasma saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and lead to modifications in the association between dietary and plasma fatty acids. These findings can perhaps be explained by a reduced hepatic fatty acid and lipoprotein synthesis as well as by an enhanced muscular lipid utilization, which are commonly seen in those who are physically active and who exhibit a higher level of fitness.",2003,Jul,Eur J Clin Nutr,57,7,810-5,,10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601613,12821879,#6271,König 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of dietary fat saturation on LDL oxidation and monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells in vitro.,Mata P; Alonso R; Lopez-Farre A; Ordovas JM; Lahoz C; Garces C; Caramelo C; Codoceo R; Blazquez E; de Oya M,"Forty-two healthy men and women were subjected to four consecutive dietary periods differing in the fat content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6) [PUFA(n-6)] and (n-3) [PUFA(n-3)]. Plasma lipids, vitamin E, and in vitro LDL oxidation were examined during each period. Adhesion of human monocytes to cultured human endothelial cells was used as a functional test to identify differences in the biological properties of LDL from each dietary period. Consumption of an SFA-rich diet resulted in higher LDL cholesterol (4.06 +/- 0.85 mmol/L, P < .05) than did consumption of MUFA- (3.59 +/- 0.75 mmol/L), PUFA(n-6)- (3.44 +/- 0.77 mmol/L), or PUFA(n-3)- (3.31 +/- 0.8 mmol/L) rich diets. HDL cholesterol was lower during both PUFA-rich diets (1.24 +/- 0.28 and 1.27 +/- 0.28 mmol/L for n-6 and n-3, respectively) than during the SFA-(1.32 +/- 0.36 mmol/L) and MUFA- (1.32 +/- 0.34 mmol/L) rich diets. LDL resistance to copper-induced oxidation, expressed as lag time, was highest during the MUFA-rich diet (55.1 +/- 7.3 minutes) and lowest during the PUFA(n-3)- (45.3 +/- 7 minutes) and SFA- (45.3 +/- 6.4 minutes) rich diets. LDL induction of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was lower during the MUFA-rich diet than the other periods. The highest monocyte adhesion was obtained during the PUFA(n-3) and SFA dietary periods. In conclusion, an MUFA-rich diet benefits plasma lipid levels compared with an SFA-rich diet.

Dietary composition affects regional body fat distribution and levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) in post-menopausal women with Type 2 diabetes.,Walker KZ; O'Dea K; Nicholson GC,"OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of a high carbohydrate (high-CHO) and a monounsaturated fat diet (high-MUFA) on body fat distribution and sex hormones in post-menopausal women with Type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Randomised cross-over with no washout. SETTING: Geelong Hospital outpatient. SUBJECTS: Thirty four women were recruited, 30 completed the study, and data are presented for 21 women compliant to the high-CHO diet. INTERVENTIONS: Women followed a high-CHO diet (20% energy (%E) from fat, 60%E from carbohydrate and a high-MUFA diet (40%E from fat, half as monounsaturated fat, 40%E from carbohydrate) in random order for 12 weeks each. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary compliance was measured by change in linoleic acid (C18:2,omega-6) in plasma cholesteryl esters. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fasting concentrations of glucose and insulin were measured in plasma. Steroid hormones and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in serum. RESULTS: On the high-CHO diet C18:2,omega-6 in plasma cholesteryl esters declined by 5.4% (95% confidence intervals (CI), -2.5% to -8.4%, P=0.0015). Fat was lost mainly from the lower body (lower body loss -0.71 kg, 95%CI, -0.43 to -1.00 kg, P=0.001; upper body loss -0.15 kg, 95%CI, -0.76 to +0.46 kg, P=0.6). Yet on the high-MUFA diet, lower body fat loss was minimal (-0.22 kg, 95%CI, +0.11 to -0.55 kg, P = 0.2). By general linear modelling (GLM), differences in lower body fat loss were significantly related to diet (P = 0.04). After adjustment for age, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) concentrations after the high-CHO diet were related to levels of lower body fat (r = 0.394, P = 0.04).

The effect of test meal monounsaturated fatty acid: saturated fatty acid ratio on postprandial lipid metabolism.,Roche HM; Zampelas A; Jackson KG; Williams CM; Gibney MJ,"Epidemiological evidence shows that a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) but low in saturated fatty acids (SFA) is associated with reduced risk of CHD. The hypocholesterolaemic effect of MUFA is known but there has been little research on the effect of test meal MUFA and SFA composition on postprandial lipid metabolism. The present study investigated the effect of meals containing different proportions of MUFA and SFA on postprandial triacylglycerol and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) metabolism. Thirty healthy male volunteers consumed three meals containing equal amounts of fat (40 g), but different proportions of MUFA (12, 17 and 24% energy) in random order. Postprandial plasma triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein B-48, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, glucose and insulin concentrations and lipoprotein lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) activity were not significantly different following the three meals which varied in their levels of SFA and MUFA. There was a significant difference in the postprandial NEFA response between meals. The incremental area under the curve of postprandial plasma NEFA concentrations was significantly (P = 0.03) lower following the high-MUFA meal. Regression analysis showed that the non-significant difference in fasting NEFA concentrations was the most important factor determining difference between meals, and that the test meal MUFA content had only a minor effect. In conclusion, varying the levels of MUFA and SFA in test meals has little or no effect on postprandial lipid metabolism.",1998,May,Br J Nutr,79,5,419-24,,10.1079/bjn19980071,9682660,#6284,Roche 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Relationship of three different types of low-carbohydrate diet to cardiometabolic risk factors in a Japanese population: the INTERMAP/INTERLIPID Study.,Nakamura Y; Ueshima H; Okuda N; Miura K; Kita Y; Miyagawa N; Yoshita K; Nakagawa H; Sakata K; Saitoh S; Okamura T; Okayama A; Choudhry SR; Rodriguez B; Masaki KH; Chan Q; Elliott P; Stamler J,"PURPOSE: Low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) are a popular dietary strategy for weight reduction. The effects of LCD on long-term outcome vary depending on type of LCD, possibly due to the fact that effects on cardiometabolic risk factors may vary with different types of LCD. Accordingly, we studied these relations. METHODS: We assessed serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and uric acid, and nutrient intakes by standardized methods in men and women ages 40-59 years from four population samples of Japanese in Japan (553 men and 544 women, combined). For people consuming usual, animal-based, and plant-based LCDs, we calculated LCD scores, based on relative level of fat, protein, and carbohydrate, by modifying the methods of Halton et al. Instead of calculating scores based on animal or vegetable fat, we used saturated fatty acids (SFA) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) + polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). RESULTS: In multivariate regression analyses with adjustment for site, age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and years of education, all three LCD scores were significantly positively related to HDLc (all P < 0.001), but not to LDLc. The plant-based LCD score was significantly inversely related to log CRP (coefficient = -0.010, P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: All three LCD scores were significantly positively related to HDLc. The plant-based LCD score was significantly inversely related to CRP. Carbohydrate intake below 50 % of total energy with higher intakes of vegetable protein and MUFA + PUFA, and lower intakes of SFA may be favorable for reducing cardiometabolic risk factors.",2016,Jun,Eur J Nutr,55,4,1515-24,,10.1007/s00394-015-0969-z,26119583,#6285,Nakamura 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Lack of influence of test meal fatty acid composition on the contribution of intestinally-derived lipoproteins to postprandial lipaemia.,Jackson KG; Zampelas A; Knapper JM; Culverwell CC; Wright J; Gould BJ; Williams CM,"The extent and duration of postprandial lipaemia have been linked to risk of CHD but the influence of dietary variables on, and the relative contributions of, exogenous (chylomicron) and endogenous (VLDL) triacylglycerols to the total lipaemic response have not been comprehensively evaluated. In the present study the triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 and retinyl ester (RE) responses to three test meals of varying monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) content were measured in the triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fraction of plasma (rho = 1.006 g/ml) for 9 h after meal consumption. Fifteen healthy normolipidaemic young men consumed, on separate occasions, three test meals which were identical apart from their MUFA and SFA contents. Expressed as a percentage of total energy the MUFA/SFA contents of the meals were: (1) 12%/17%; (2) 17%/12% and (3) 24%/5%. The contribution of the intestinally-derived lipoproteins (chylomicrons) to the lipaemic response was investigated by determining the time to reach peak concentration and the total and incremental areas under the time response curves (AUC and incremental AUC) for RE, apoB-48 and triacylglycerol in the TRL fraction. No significant differences in these measurements were observed for the three meals. However, visual comparison of the postprandial responses to the three meals suggested that as meal MUFA content increased there was a tendency for the triacylglycerol, apoB-48 and RE responses to become biphasic as opposed to the typical monophasic response seen with the 12% MUFA/17% SFA meal. Comparison of the apoB-48 and RE responses for the three test meals confirmed other workers' findings of delayed entry of RE relative to apoB-48 in TRL.

The hazard ratio of CVD for each 5% of energy from macronutrients at the expense of another macronutrient was calculated using the substitution model. During follow-up, a total of 206 CVD outcomes were identified. Mean age of participants (44.2% men) was 47.0 ± 12 and 45.6 ± 11 for men and women, respectively. Substituting 5% of energy from all types of macronutrients by 5% percentage of energy from combined saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was associated with a decrease in the risk of CVD by almost 20%. Higher energy intake from total-, starchy-, and nonstarchy carbohydrates replaced by other macronutrients was not significantly associated with the risk of CVD. Each 5% of energy from animal protein (HR: 1.09 and CI: 1.02-1.16) independently increased the risk of CVD in the adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. CONCLUSION: Higher percentage of energy from animal protein independently increased the risk of CVD, replacement of SFA and MUFA together with other macronutrients was inversely associated with CVD risk.",2020,Nov,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,30,12,2186-2193,,10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.017,32980248,#6296,Hosseini-Esfahani 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Cholesterol reduction using manufactured foods high in monounsaturated fatty acids: a randomized crossover study.,Williams CM; Francis-Knapper JA; Webb D; Brookes CA; Zampelas A; Tredger JA; Wright J; Meijer G; Calder PC; Yaqoob P; Roche H; Gibney MJ,"In two separate studies, the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was evaluated by means of a randomized crossover trial. In both studies subjects were randomized to receive either a high-MUFA diet or the control diet first, which they followed for a period of 8 weeks; following a washout period of 4-6 weeks they were transferred onto the opposing diet for a further period of 8 weeks. In one study subjects were healthy middle-aged men (n 30), and in the other they were young men (n 23) with a family history of CHD recruited from two centres (Guildford and Dublin). The two studies were conducted over the same time period using identical foods and study designs. Subjects consumed 38% energy as fat, with 18% energy as MUFA and 10% as saturated fatty acids (MUFA diet), or 13% energy as MUFA and 16% as saturated fatty acids (control diet). The polyunsaturated fatty acid content of each diet was 7%. The diets were achieved by providing subjects with manufactured foods such as spreads, 'ready meals', biscuits, puddings and breads, which, apart from their fatty acid compositions, were identical for both diets. Subjects were blind to which of the diets they were following on both arms of the study. Weight changes on the diets were less than 1 kg. In the groups combined (n 53) mean total and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower at the end of the MUFA diet than the control diet by 0.29 (SD 0.61) mmol/l (P < 0.001) and 0.38 (SD 0.64) mmol/l (P < 0.0001) respectively. In middle-aged men these differences were due to a mean reduction in LDL-cholesterol of -11 (SD 12)% on the MUFA diet with no change on the control diet (-1.1 (SD 10)%). In young men the differences were due to an increase in LDL-cholesterol concentration on the control diet of +6.2 (SD 13)% and a decrease on the MUFA diet of -7.8 (SD 20)%. Differences in the responses of middle-aged and young men to the two diets did not appear to be due to differences in their habitual baseline diets which were generally similar, but appeared to reflect the lower baseline cholesterol concentrations in the younger men. There was a moderately strong and statistically significant inverse correlation between the change in LDL-cholesterol concentration on each diet and the baseline fasting LDL-cholesterol concentration (r -0.49; P < 0.0005). In conclusion, diets in which saturated fat is partially replaced by MUFA can achieve significant reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, even when total fat and energy intakes are maintained. The dietary approach used to alter fatty acid intakes would be appropriate for achieving reductions in saturated fat intakes in whole populations.",1999,Jun,Br J Nutr,81,6,439-46,,,10615219,#6299,Williams 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of reduced-fat diets with different fatty acid compositions on serum lipoprotein lipids and apolipoproteins.,Aro A; Pietinen P; Valsta LM; Turpeinen AM; Ehnholm C; Dougherty RM; Iacono JM,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects on serum lipoproteins of three isocaloric diets with reduced total fat and saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents but with different proportions of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). DESIGN: A low-fat diet (LF) provided 20 en% fat, 7.9% SFA, 7.8% MUFA, 3.0% PUFA; a high-PUFA diet (HP) 26 en% fat, 7.5% SFA, 8.2% MUFA, 8.1% PUFA; and a high-MUFA diet (HM) 26 en% fat, 7.3% SFA, 14.1% MUFA, 3.2% PUFA. Diets were consumed for 8 weeks in a parallel design, after 2 weeks on a habitual diet with 33-34 en% fat, 13-14% SFA, 12% MUFA, 6% PUFA, and followed by an 8-week period on habitual diet. Compliance to diet was monitored by repeated food records and weekly visits to a nutritionist. SUBJECTS: 45 free-living, middle-aged couples who were randomly allocated into the three diet groups; 43 men and 44 women completed the study. RESULTS: During the diet periods, a small but significant reduction in body weight of 0.4-1.0 kg was observed in all groups. Similar and significant reductions of mean weight-adjusted serum total cholesterol (4-8%), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (7-11%), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (8-11%) were observed during the diets. HDL2-cholesterol and apoprotein (apo) A-I levels were reduced whereas HDL3-cholesterol and apoA-II increased. ApoB was significantly decreased during the HM diet only. Serum triglycerides increased significantly during diets LF (25%, P < 0.01) and HP (19%, P < 0.05) but not during diet HM (5%, NS). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in the intake of total fat and saturated fatty acids reduced serum LDL-cholesterol and HDL2-cholesterol concentrations irrespective of the relative proportions of MUFA and PUFA in the diets. The results suggest that there might be some advantage in increasing the proportion of MUFA in low-fat diets, since the HM diet rich in MUFA reduced apoB and slightly attenuated the increase in serum triglycerides that is commonly associated with dietary fat reduction.",1998,Jun,Public Health Nutr,1,2,109-16,,10.1079/phn19980017,10933407,#6303,Aro 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Decrease in von Willebrand factor levels after a high-monounsaturated-fat diet in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects.,Rasmussen O; Thomsen C; Ingerslev J; Hermansen K,"High levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) have been reported in diabetics with vascular complications, suggesting a role for this protein in the development of cardiovascular complications in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Recently, a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) has been found to improve glycemic control and decrease diurnal blood pressure as compared with a high-carbohydrate (H-CHO) diet in NIDDM subjects. To study the impact of MUFA on the hemostatic system, we compared the levels of vWF, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and alpha 2-macroglobulin before and after 3 weeks on a high-MUFA (H-MUFA) diet and on an isocaloric H-CHO diet in 15 NIDDM subjects. In a crossover study, the patients were randomly assigned to a H-CHO diet (50% carbohydrate, 30% fat [10% MUFA]) or a H-MUFA diet (30% carbohydrate, 50% fat [30% MUFA]). Before and on the last day of the two diets, vWF, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and alpha 2-macroglobulin levels were measured. The H-MUFA diet caused a decrease in vWF from 1.31 +/- 0.08 to 1.13 +/- 0.08 U/mL (P < .004), whereas an unchanged level was observed after a H-CHO diet (1.19 +/- 0.11 v 1.25 +/- 0.11 U/mL, NS). The relative changes in vWF during 3 weeks on a H-MUFA and on a H-CHO diet attained -12.5% +/- 3.2% versus 5.7% +/- 3.5%, respectively (P < .0001). Furthermore, unchanged levels of fibrinogen, fibronectin, and alpha 2-macroglobulin were seen after usage of the two diets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,Nov,Metabolism,43,11,1406-9,,10.1016/0026-0495(94)90036-1,7526126,#6305,Rasmussen 1994,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Lack of effect on blood pressure by low fat diets with different fatty acid compositions.,Aro A; Pietinen P; Valsta LM; Salminen I; Turpeinen AM; Virtanen M; Dougherty RM; Iacono JM,"We compared the effects on blood pressure (BP) of three isocaloric diets with reduced total fat and saturated fatty acid (SAFA) contents but with different proportions of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Diet LF (low fat) provided 20 en% fat (7.9% SAFA, 7.8% MUFA, 3.0% PUFA); diet HP (high PUFA) 26 en% fat (7.5% SAFA, 8.2% MUFA, 8.1% PUFA), and diet HM (high MUFA) 26 en% fat (7.3% SAFA, 14.1% MUFA, 3.2% PUFA). The diets were consumed for 8 weeks (intervention) preceded by 2 weeks and followed by 8 weeks on a habitual diet (baseline/ switchback) with 33-34 en% fat (13-14% SAFA, 12% MUFA, 6% PUFA). Forty-five free-living couples were randomly allocated into the three diet groups, and 43 men and 44 women completed the study. BP was measured weekly with an automatic device. Compliance to diet was monitored by repeated food records, serum fatty acid compositions, and weekly visits to a nutritionist. Both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) remained unchanged throughout the study in all three groups. The weight-adjusted mean (s.e.m.) BP values showed changes in SBP of +1.7 (1.8), -0.4 (1.7), and +1.9 (1.9) mm Hg on the LF, HP, and HM diets, respectively (difference NS), and DBP of +0.1 (1.0), +0.6 (1.0), and -0.3 (1.0) mm Hg, respectively (difference NS) between the last 2 weeks of the baseline and intervention periods. The expected fatty acid intakes were achieved, and there were no between-group differences in change of body weight, intake of dietary fibre and potassium, and 24-h sodium excretion. A reduction in total fat and SAFA intake and changes in the proportions of dietary MUFA and PUFA did not affect the BP levels of this normotensive population with an adequate intake of PUFA at baseline.",1998,Jun,J Hum Hypertens,12,6,383-9,,10.1038/sj.jhh.1000610,9705040,#6313,Aro 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Protective Effects of Dietary MUFAs Mediating Metabolites against Hypertension Risk in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study.,Lee H; Jang HB; Yoo MG; Chung KS; Lee HJ,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metabolites related to dietary factors can be used to identify biological markers to prevent metabolic disease. However, most studies have been conducted in the United States and Europe, and those in the Asian region are limited. We investigated the effects of dietary monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and metabolites on new-onset hypertension in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. METHOD AND RESULTS: A total of 1529 subjects without hypertension were divided into tertiles of dietary MUFAs intake. After a 4-year follow-up, 135 serum metabolites were measured using the AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit. During the 4-year follow-up period, 193 new-onset hypertension incidences were observed. The highest MUFAs intake group was inversely associated with the risk of hypertension compared with the lowest MUFAs intake group (odds ratio (OR) = 0.49, (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29-0.82)). Of the 135 metabolites, eight were significantly associated with MUFAs intake. Phosphatidylcholine-diacyl (PC aa) C 38:1 and hydroxysphingomyelin (SM OH) C 16:1 were associated with a decrease in hypertension risk (PC aa C 38:1, OR = 0.60 (95% CI = 0.37-0.96); SM OH C 16:1, OR = 0.42 (95% CI = 0.20-0.90)). The highest MUFAs intake group had a significantly decreased risk of hypertension, even considering PC aa C 38:1 and SM (OH) C 16:1 as a mediator. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that dietary MUFAs intake, and PC aa C 38:1 and SM (OH) C 16:1 had protective effects against hypertension. Furthermore, high MUFAs intake combined with PC aa C 38:1 and SM (OH) C 16:1 has the most significant effect on reducing the risk hypertension.",2019,Aug,Nutrients,11,8,,,10.3390/nu11081928,31426326,#6316,Lee 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Adiponectin gene variants are associated with insulin sensitivity in response to dietary fat consumption in Caucasian men.,Pérez-Martínez P; López-Miranda J; Cruz-Teno C; Delgado-Lista J; Jiménez-Gómez Y; Fernández JM; Gómez MJ; Marín C; Pérez-Jiménez F; Ordovás JM,"Adiponectin (adipoQ) gene variants have been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. Our aim was to examine whether the presence of several polymorphisms at the adipoQ gene locus (-11391 G > A, -11377 C > G, 45 T > G, and 276 G > T) influences the insulin sensitivity to dietary fat. Healthy volunteers (30 men and 29 women) consumed 3 diets for 4 wk each: an initial period during which all subjects consumed a SFA-rich diet (38% total fat, 20% SFA), followed by a carbohydrate-rich diet (CHO) (30% total fat, 55% carbohydrate) or a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diet (38% total fat, 22% MUFA) following a randomized, crossover design. After participants consumed each diet, we tested peripheral insulin sensitivity with the insulin suppression test and measured plasma adiponectin concentrations. C/C homozygous men for the -11377 C > G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) had a significantly greater decrease in the steady-state plasma glucose concentrations when changing from the SFA-rich (8.95 +/- 0.6 mmol/L) to the MUFA-rich (6.04 +/- 0.31 mmol/L) and CHO-rich (6.35 +/- 0.38 mmol/L) diets than did those carrying the minor G allele (SFA, 6.65 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; MUFA, 6.45 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; CHO, 5.83 +/- 0.3 mmol/L) (P sex x gene x diet interaction = 0.016). These differences did not occur in female participants. Furthermore, C/C men had lower plasma adiponectin concentrations than did C/C women (P sex x gene interaction = 0.015), independently of the dietary fat consumed. None of the variables examined were significantly associated with -11426 A > G, 45T > G, or 276 G > T SNP. In conclusion, C/C homozygous men for the -11377 C > G SNP at adipoQ gene were significantly less insulin resistant after consumption of the MUFA- and CHO-rich diets compared with the SFA-rich diet.

Effect of meal composition on postprandial lipid concentrations and lipoprotein particle numbers: A randomized cross-over study.,Shah M; Jaffery M; Adams-Huet B; Franklin B; Oliver J; Mitchell J,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear how high-protein (HP) and high-monounsaturated fat (HMF) meals affect postprandial blood lipids and lipoprotein particle numbers (LPN). PURPOSE: To compare a HP versus a HMF meal on postprandial lipid and LPN responses. METHODS: Twenty-four participants (age: 36.3±15.0 years; body mass index: 23.6±2.0 kg/m2; 45.8% female) were fed a HP (31.9% energy from protein) and a HMF (35.2% fat and 20.7% monounsaturated fat) meal in a randomized cross-over trial design. Energy and carbohydrate content were the same across meals. Blood samples were drawn in the fasting state and 3 hour postprandial state, and assessed for lipids and LPN. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis showed a significant (p<0.05) treatment by time interaction effect for triglycerides (TG), the primary variable, total high-density lipoprotein particles (T-HDLP) and T-HDLP minus large-buoyant high-density lipoprotein 2b (T-HDLP-LB-HDL2b). HP versus HMF condition led to significantly lower TG at 120 (geometric mean: 90.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 76.4-106.3) vs. 146.5 (124.2-172.9) mg/dL) and 180 (101.4 (83.1-123.8) vs. 148.7 (121.9-181.4) mg/dL) min and higher T-HDLP at 120 (mean difference: 297.3 (95% CI: 48.6-545.9) nmol/L) and 180 (291.6 (15.8-567.5) nmol/L) min. The difference in T-HDLP by condition was due to the significantly higher small-dense HDLP (T-HDLP-LB-HDL2b) during HP versus HMF condition at 120 (mean difference: 452.6 (95% CI: 177.4-727.9) nmol/L) and 180 (496.8 (263.1-730.6) nmol/L) min. Area under the curve analysis showed that HP versus HMF condition led to significantly lower TG, non-HDLP, and very-low-density lipoprotein particles (VLDLP) responses but significantly less favorable responses in LB-HDL2b particles, T-HDLP-LB-HDL2b, and LB-HDL2b/T-HDLP ratio. CONCLUSION: The HP meal led to lower TG, non-HDLP, and VLDLP but less favorable LB-HDL2b, small-dense HDLP, and LB-HDL2b/T-HDLP ratio responses versus a HMF meal. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings over multiple meals.",2017,,PLoS One,12,2,e0172732,,10.1371/journal.pone.0172732,28222178,#6321,Shah 2017,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Effects of different dietary cholesterol concentrations on lipoprotein plasma concentrations and on cholesterol efflux from Fu5AH cells.,Blanco-Molina A; Castro G; Martín-Escalante D; Bravo D; López-Miranda J; Castro P; López-Segura F; Fruchart JC; Ordovás JM; Pérez-Jiménez F,"BACKGROUND: The fatty acid composition of the diet can modulate the effect of dietary cholesterol on plasma lipoproteins. However, HDL composition and its capacity to promote cholesterol efflux can be influenced by the diet. OBJECTIVE: Modifications in plasma lipids and in the capacity of serum to stimulate the cholesterol efflux induced by a low-fat diet [National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step I diet], by a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diet, and by addition of cholesterol to both diets was studied. DESIGN: Fifteen young, healthy men followed 2 NCEP Step I diets (<30% of fat as energy, with <10% saturated fat and 14% MUFAs) for 24 d, providing 0.027 or 0.068 mg cholesterol x kJ(-1) x d(-1), and 2 oleic acid-enriched diets (38% of energy as fat, with 24% MUFAs) providing the same amount of dietary cholesterol as the NCEP Step I diets. RESULTS: Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) B, and apo A-I concentrations decreased after the NCEP Step I and MUFA diets compared with the usual diet. HDL cholesterol also decreased after the NCEP Step I diet. Total:HDL cholesterol, apo B, and apo B:apo A-I were lower after the MUFA diets than after the NCEP Step I diets. There were no significant differences between the lipid profiles obtained after the NCEP Step I and MUFA diets were enriched with cholesterol. The capacity of serum to promote cholesterol efflux was significantly higher after the cholesterol-enriched NCEP Step I diet than after the NCEP Step I diet. CONCLUSIONS: The MUFA diet induced a better lipid profile than the NCEP Step I diet; however, the increase in the cholesterol content of both diets produced similar plasma lipid changes.

Achievement of dietary fatty acid intakes in long-term controlled intervention studies: approach and methodology.,Nydahl MC; Smith RD; Kelly CN; Fielding BA; Williams CM,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the calculations and approaches used to design experimental diets of differing saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) compositions for use in a long-term dietary intervention study, and to evaluate the degree to which the dietary targets were met. DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Fifty-one students living in a university hall of residence consumed a reference (SFA) diet for 8 weeks followed by either a moderate MUFA (MM) diet or a high MUFA (HM) diet for 16 weeks. The three diets were designed to differ only in their proportions of SFA and MUFA, while keeping total fat, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), trans-fatty acids, and the ratio of palmitic to stearic acid, and n-6 to n-3 PUFA, unchanged. RESULTS: Using habitual diet records and a standardised database for food fatty acid compositions, a sequential process of theoretical fat substitutions enabled suitable fat sources for use in the three diets to be identified, and experimental margarines for baking, spreading and the manufacture of snack foods to be designed. The dietary intervention was largely successful in achieving the fatty acid targets of the three diets, although unintended differences between the original target and the analysed fatty acid composition of the experimental margarines resulted in a lower than anticipated MUFA intake on the HM diet, and a lower ratio of palmitic to stearic acid compared with the reference or MM diet.

[Effects of dietary fat saturation on levels of plasma lipoprotein (a) and lipids].,Lahoz C; Alonso R; Porres A; Mata P,"BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) is a known risk factor for coronary heart disease. Lp(a) plasma concentration mainly depends on genetic polymorphism. The aim of this study was evaluate the effect of dietary fat saturation on Lp(a) plasma concentration. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty two subjects (eighteen women and twenty four men) were placed in four consecutive 5 weeks diet periods. Energy intake from proteins, carbohydrates and fats was constant during the study and there were only changes on fatty acids composition. First period was enriched in saturated fatty acids (SFA), second period in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and third and fourth periods were enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Fourth period was also enriched in PUFA n-3 (blue fish). RESULTS: Changes on dietary fat saturation had a significant effect on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Lp(a) plasma concentration was minimum in SFA phase (6.8 [SD 7.3] mg/dl), increasing during MUFA phase (8.7 [8.5] mg/dl) and was maximum in PUFA n-6 and PUFA n-3 (11.5 [11.1] and 12.7 [11.9] mg/dl, respectively) (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Changes on dietary fat saturation significantly modify Lp(a) plasma concentration. These variations went in opposite direction to LDL-cholesterol modifications and were clinically irrelevant.",1998,May,Med Clin (Barc),110,17,641-5,,,9656207,#6411,Lahoz 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,Awaiting PDF

Interactions between ADIPOQ gene variants and dietary monounsaturated: saturated fatty acid ratio on serum lipid levels in Korean children.,Park JY; Lee HJ; Jang HB; Hwang JY; Kang JH; Han BG; Lee JY; Song J,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adiponectin plays important roles in the regulation of insulin action and metabolism of glucose and lipids. We investigated whether ADIPOQ genetic variants are associated with serum lipid levels in Korean children and whether those influences might be modulated by dietary factors such as dietary monounsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid ratio (MUFA:SFA). METHOD AND RESULTS: The study included a population-based sample of 687 children aged 7-11 years in Gwacheon city, Kyunggi Province, Korea. Anthropometric and biochemical measurements and ADIPOQ genotype (-11377 C/G, +45 T/G, and +276 G/T) were determined. Dietary intake was estimated with a self reported 3-day food diary. The -11377 G allele carriers had significantly higher serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared to non-carriers. When dietary MUFA:SFA ratio was dichotomized (MUFA:SFA ≥ 1 or <1), the aggravating effects of the minor allele on serum total and LDL cholesterol were only present when the MUFA:SFA ratio was <1. Additionally, we observed that the ADIPOQ haplotype influenced serum total and LDL cholesterol levels. G-T-G haplotype carriers had higher total and LDL cholesterol levels than non-G-T-G carriers. The deleterious effect of ADIPOQ G-T-G haplotype to increase serum total and LDL cholesterol could be seen only when the MUFA:SFA ratio was <1. CONCLUSION: In this present study, we found interaction effects between ADIPOQ genetic variants and dietary MUFA:SFA ratio on serum lipid levels in Korean children. These results suggest that individual genetic information and dietary fatty acid intake information should be assessed together to achieve an effective outcome for reducing the atherogenic lipid profile.",2014,Jan,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,24,1,83-90,,10.1016/j.numecd.2013.04.007,23806739,#6444,Park 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

Apolipoprotein A2 -265 T>C polymorphism interacts with dietary fatty acids intake to modulate inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.,Keramat L; Sadrzadeh-Yeganeh H; Sotoudeh G; Zamani E; Eshraghian M; Mansoori A; Koohdani F,"OBJECTIVE: Several investigations have been conducted regarding the interaction between Apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2) -265 T>C polymorphism and dietary intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) on obesity in healthy individuals or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM) patients. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of this interaction on inflammatory markers in T2 DM patients. METHODS: This is a comparative cross-sectional study on 180 T2 DM patients with known APOA2 genotype. Dietary intake was assessed by food-frequency questionnaire and serum levels of inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-18, pentraxin 3, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]) were measured. The subjects were dichotomized into ""high"" and ""low"" categories, based on the median dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and SFAs. The data were analyzed by analysis of covariance multivariate interaction model. RESULTS: In CC genotype, higher median intake of ω-3 PUFAs and MUFAs was associated with decreased serum levels of IL-18 and hs-CRP (P = 0.014 and 0.008, respectively). In T-allele carriers, higher median intake of SFAs was associated with increased serum hs-CRP level (P < 0.001). There was a significant relationship between APOA2 polymorphism and ω-3 PUFA intake on serum IL-18 level (P interaction = 0.03). Moreover, the relationship between this polymorphism and SFA and MUFA intake on serum hs-CRP level was statistically significant (P interaction = 0.03 and 0.024, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In T2 DM patients, the dietary intake of antiinflammatory fatty acids, such as ω-3 PUFAs and MUFAs, could reduce the inflammatory effects associated with the CC genotype. In addition, proinflammatory fatty acids, such as SFAs, could overcome the antiinflammatory effect of the T-allele. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",2017,May,Nutrition,37,,86-91,,10.1016/j.nut.2016.12.012,28359369,#6452,Keramat 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary influence on adiponectin in patients with type 2 diabetes.,Bozzetto L; Polito R; Nigro E; Prinster A; Della Pepa G; Costabile G; Vetrani C; Vitale M; Daniele A; Rivellese AA; Annuzzi G,"BACKGROUND: Here, we evaluate the effects of a diet rich in low-glycaemic index carbohydrates and fibre (CHO/Fibre diet) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA diet), on fasting and postprandial adiponectin concentrations and their relationship with the beneficial effects of the experimental diets on postprandial glucose metabolism and liver fat in type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Fasting and postprandial adiponectin plasma concentrations were measured before and after dietary interventions in the participants to a randomized controlled trial (NCT01025856), wherein 37 men and 8 women with T2D, aged 35-70 years, followed a CHO/Fibre diet or a MUFA diet for an 8-week period. Hepatic fat content by (1) H NMR and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and insulin measurements were also available. RESULTS: Fasting adiponectin plasma levels did not change after both diets. Postprandial adiponectin significantly increased after the CHO/fibre diet (9.9 ± 1.6 μg/mL vs. 10.8 ± 2.3 μg/mL; P = .033) but not after the MUFA diet (10.6 ± 1.8 μg/mL vs. 10.6 ± 1.6 μg/mL; P = .935) with a significant difference between changes (P = .035). In the combined CHO/Fibre and MUFA groups, fasting and postprandial adiponectin significantly and inversely correlated with postprandial insulin iAUC at baseline and after intervention, and with liver fat content after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A diet rich in CHO/Fibre increased postprandial plasma adiponectin significantly more than a MUFA diet in patients with T2D. Independently of diet, adiponectin levels associated with postprandial insulin concentrations. The dietary interventions modulated the relationship between adiponectin and liver fat.",2021,Aug,Eur J Clin Invest,51,8,e13548,,10.1111/eci.13548,33797089,#6453,Bozzetto 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary monounsaturated fatty acids intake and risk of skin photoaging.,Latreille J; Kesse-Guyot E; Malvy D; Andreeva V; Galan P; Tschachler E; Hercberg S; Guinot C; Ezzedine K,"BACKGROUND: Intake of monounsaturated fatty acids has been reported to reduce oxidative stress, insulin resistance and related inflammatory processes and may thus protect from skin photoaging. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the risk of photoaging, monounsaturated fatty acids intake and the sources of monounsaturated fatty acids. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cross sectional study was conducted within the framework of the SUVIMAX cohort. The survey included 1264 women and 1655 men aged between 45 and 60 years old. Dietary monounsaturated fatty acids intakes were estimated by dietary source through at least ten 24-h diet records completed during the first 2.5 years of the follow-up period. Severity of facial skin photoaging was graded by trained investigators at baseline during a clinical examination using a 6-grade scale illustrated by photographs. A lower risk of severe photoaging was associated with higher intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil in both sexes. Strikingly, no association was found with intake of monounsaturated fatty acids from animal sources whether from dairy products, meat or processed meat. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings support the beneficial effect of dietary olive oil or healthy diet habits associated with olive oil consumption on the severity of facial photoaging.",2012,,PLoS One,7,9,e44490,,10.1371/journal.pone.0044490,22970231,#6454,Latreille 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
High-carbohydrate-low-glycaemic index dietary advice improves glucose disposition index in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.,Wolever TM; Mehling C,"Controversy exists about the optimal amount and source of dietary carbohydrate for managing insulin resistance. Therefore, we compared the effects on insulin sensitivity (SI), pancreatic responsivity (AIRglu) and glucose disposition index of dietary advice aimed at reducing the amount or altering the source of dietary carbohydrate in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Subjects were randomized to high-carbohydrate-high-glycaemic index (GI) (high-GI, n 11), high-carbohydrate-low-GI (low-GI, n 13), or low-carbohydrate-high-monounsaturated fat (MUFA, n 11) dietary advice, with SI, AIRglu and DI measured using a frequently sampled, intravenous glucose tolerance test before and after 4 months treatment. Carbohydrate and fat intakes and diet GI, respectively, were: high-GI, 53 %, 28 %, 83; low-GI, 55 %, 25 %, 76; MUFA, 47 %, 35 %, 82. Weight changes on each diet differed significantly from each other: high-GI, -0.49 (sem 0.29) kg; low-GI, -0.19 (sem 0.40) kg; MUFA +0.27 (sem 0.45) kg. Blood lipids did not change, but glycated haemoglobin increased significantly on MUFA, 0.02 (sem 0.11) %, relative to low-GI, -0.19 (sem 0.08) %, and high-GI, -0.13 (sem 0.14) %. Diastolic blood pressure fell by 8 mmHg on low-GI relative to MUFA (P=0.038). Although SI and AIRglu did not change significantly, DI, a measure of the ability of beta-cells to overcome insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion, increased on low-GI by >50 % (P=0.02). After adjusting for baseline values, the increase in DI on low-GI, 0.17 (sem 0.07), was significantly greater than those on MUFA, -0.09 (sem 0.08) and high-GI, -0.03 (sem 0.02) (P=0.019). Thus, the long-term effects of altering the source of dietary carbohydrate differ from those of altering the amount. High-carbohydrate-low-GI dietary advice improved beta-cell function in subjects with IGT, and may, therefore, be useful in the management of IGT.",2002,May,Br J Nutr,87,5,477-87,,10.1079/BJNBJN2002568,12010586,#6457,Wolever 2002,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
A Mediterranean dietary intervention in healthy American women changes plasma carotenoids and fatty acids in distinct clusters.,Djuric Z; Ren J; Blythe J; VanLoon G; Sen A,"This study examined patterns of changes in plasma fatty acids and carotenoids when women were asked to follow a novel, Greek-Mediterranean exchange list diet. A total of 69 healthy, nonobese women ages 25 to 59 years were randomized either to continue their own usual diet or to follow a modified Mediterranean diet for 6 months. There were no significant changes in blood lipids, triacylglycerol, insulin, glucose, or C-reactive protein. Mean plasma carotenoids increased by 55%, which is consistent with a large increase in fruit and vegetable consumption. Likewise, changes in fat intakes were reflected in blood fatty acids, with a 25% increase in mean plasma monounsaturated fatty acids. Principal component analysis was conducted to examine the sources of interindividual variation for changes in carotenoid and fatty acid levels. Changes in the Mediterranean diet were clustered together in 4 components that accounted for 78% of the variance in plasma levels. Increases in plasma lutein, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene clustered together in a ""vegetable"" pattern, and increases in carotenoids found in fruit, beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin also clustered together but accounted for less of the variance. Increases in plasma monounsaturated fatty acids were clustered with a decrease in plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids, consistent with substitution in the type of oils consumed. The only association of fatty acid levels with carotenoids was that of lycopene, which clustered together with an increase in saturated fatty acids. The changes in blood levels indicate the exchange list diet was effective for targeting Mediterranean nutrient intakes using foods available in the United States.",2009,Mar,Nutr Res,29,3,156-63,,10.1016/j.nutres.2009.03.001,19358929,#6461,Djuric 2009,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fat intake and risk of coronary heart disease: the Strong Heart Study.,Xu J; Eilat-Adar S; Loria C; Goldbourt U; Howard BV; Fabsitz RR; Zephier EM; Mattil C; Lee ET,"BACKGROUND: The results of previous studies on the association between dietary fat intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the association between dietary fat intake and CHD incidence in American Indians in the Strong Heart Study. DESIGN: A total of 2938 participants aged 47-79 y and free of CHD at the second examination (1993-1995) were examined and followed for CHD, nonfatal CHD, and fatal CHD events to 31 December 2002. Dietary intake was assessed by using a 24-h diet recall and was calculated as percentages of energy. RESULTS: Participants were followed for a mean (+/-SD) of 7.2 +/- 2.3 y. During follow-up, 436 incident CHD cases (298 nonfatal CHD and 138 fatal CHD events) were ascertained. Participants aged 47-59 y in the highest quartile of intake of total fat, saturated fatty acids, or monounsaturated fatty acids had higher CHD mortality than did those in the lowest quartile [hazard ratio (95% CI): 3.57 (1.21, 10.49), 5.17 (1.64, 16.36), and 3.43 (1.17, 10.04), respectively] after confounders were controlled for. These associations were not observed for those aged 60-79 y. CONCLUSIONS: Total fat, saturated fatty acid, and monounsaturated fatty acid intake were strong predictors of CHD mortality in American Indians aged 47-59 y, independent of other established CHD risk factors. It may be prudent for American Indians to reduce their fat intake early in life to reduce the risk of dying from CHD.",2006,Oct,Am J Clin Nutr,84,4,894-902,,10.1093/ajcn/84.4.894,17023718,#6464,Xu 2006,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Exchanging carbohydrates for monounsaturated fats in energy-restricted diets: effects on metabolic profile and other cardiovascular risk factors.,Colette C; Percheron C; Pares-Herbute N; Michel F; Pham TC; Brillant L; Descomps B; Monnier L,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, as observed in energy-balance conditions after exchanging carbohydrates (CHO) for monounsaturated (MUFA) fats, are also observed in energy-restricted conditions. DESIGN: Longitudinal, clinical intervention study using two types of energy-restricted diets (-30% of initial energy intake) with similar levels of saturated and polyunsaturated fats: a high CHO diet (55% of energy from CHOs, 10% from MUFAs) and a high MUFA diet (40% of energy from CHOs, 25% from MUFAs). SUBJECTS: A total of 32 overweight subjects (nine males, 23 females, BMI: 26-45 kg/m(2)). MEASUREMENTS: Body weight, serum lipids, fasting plasma insulin and phospholipid fatty acid composition of red blood cells were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Various oxidative status parameters (plasma lipid hydroperoxides, total plasma antioxidant capacity, plasma uric acid and vitamin E) and serum-induced smooth muscular cell (SMC) proliferation were also measured at these time points. RESULTS: Weight loss (1.1 kg/week over the first 4 weeks and 6.7 kg at week 8) was not significantly affected by the diet composition. Both diets reduced significantly total serum cholesterol, but the MUFA-rich diet showed better effects on fasting serum triacylglycerol (TG) than the CHO-rich diet: 1.18 vs 1.51 mmol/l for the MUFA-rich diet (after vs before, P<0.05) and 1.42 vs 1.62 for the CHO-rich diet. After 8 weeks, plasma vitamin E concentrations were positively associated with the oleic acid level of red blood cell phospholipids and showed opposite variations in both diets (increase with the MUFA-rich diet and decrease with the CHO-rich diet). Relative changes in SMC proliferation induced by sera were negatively associated with the ratio oleic:linoleic acid of red blood cell phospholipids and were significantly higher with the CHO-rich diet. CONCLUSIONS: The MUFA-rich diet showed better effects on serum TG than the CHO-rich diet, even with energy restriction and weight loss. The results suggest also a protective effect of oleic acid on oxidative stress and SMC proliferation, two other important cardiovascular risk factors.",2003,Jun,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,27,6,648-56,,10.1038/sj.ijo.0802299,12833107,#6467,Colette 2003,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Long-term monounsaturated fatty acid diets reduce platelet aggregation in healthy young subjects.,Smith RD; Kelly CN; Fielding BA; Hauton D; Silva KD; Nydahl MC; Miller GJ; Williams CM,"The aim of the present study was to compare the response of a range of atherogenic and thrombogenic risk markers to two dietary levels of saturated fatty acid (SFA) substitution with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in students living in a university hall of residence. Although the benefits of such diets have been reported for plasma lipoproteins in high-risk groups, more needs to be known about effects of more modest SFA-MUFA substitutions over the long term and in young healthy adults. In a parallel design over 16 weeks, fifty-one healthy young subjects were randomised to one of two diets: (1) a moderate-MUFA diet in which 16 g dietary SFA/100 g total fatty acids were substituted with MUFA (n 25); (2) a high-MUFA diet in which 33 g dietary SFA/100 g total fatty acids were substituted with MUFA (n 26). All subjects followed an 8-week run-in diet (reference diet), with a fatty acid composition close to the UK average values. There were no differences in plasma lipid responses between the two diets over 16 weeks of the study with similar reductions in total cholesterol (P<0.001) and LDL-cholesterol (P<0.01) in both groups; a small but significant reduction in HDL-cholesterol was also observed in both groups (P<0.01). Platelet responses to ADP (P<0.01) and arachidonic acid (P<0.05) differed with time on the two diets; at 16 weeks, platelet aggregatory response to ADP was significantly lower on the high-MUFA than the moderate-MUFA (P<0.01) diet; ADP responses were also significantly lower within this group at 8 (P<0.05) and 16 (P<0.01) weeks compared with baseline. There were no differences in fasting factor VII activity (factors VIIc and VIIag), fibrinogen concentration or tissue-type plasminogen activator activity between the diets. There were no differences in postprandial factor VIIc responses to a standard meal (area under the curve) between the diets after 16 weeks, but postprandial factor VIIc response was lower than on the high-MUFA diet compared with baseline (P<0.01). In conclusion, a high-MUFA diet sustains potentially beneficial effects on platelet aggregation and postprandial activation of factor VII. Moderate or high substitution of MUFA for SFA achieves similar reductions in fasting blood lipids in young healthy subjects.",2003,Sep,Br J Nutr,90,3,597-606,,10.1079/bjn2003953,13129466,#6469,Smith 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Habitual dietary intake of fatty acids are associated with leptin gene expression in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue of patients without diabetes.,Rostami H; Samadi M; Yuzbashian E; Zarkesh M; Asghari G; Hedayati M; Daneshafrooz A; Mirmiran P; Khalaj A,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of leptin gene expression in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues with habitual fatty acid intake and its subtypes in adults. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues were gathered from 97 participants aged ≥ 20, who had undergone elective abdominal surgery. Dietary fatty acid intakes including total fatty acids (TFA), saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), n-3, n-6, and n-9 fatty acids were collected using a valid and reliable food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The leptin gene expression in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues was measured by Real-Time PCR. After controlling for body mass index (BMI) and insulin, energy-adjusted dietary intake of SFA was positively and MUFA and n-3 fatty acids were negatively associated with subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues leptin gene expression. Besides, a significant negative association of PUFA, n-6, and n-9 fatty acids with leptin mRNA from visceral adipose tissue were observed. In order to better interpretations of the results, the participants were allocated two groups including non-obese (BMI < 30kg/m(2)) and obese subjects (BMI ≥ 30kg/m(2)). Among non-obese participants, the SFA had positive and PUFA had negative association with leptin gene expression in both adipose tissues. Furthermore, in obese participants, n-3, n-6, and n-9 fatty acids had a negative association with visceral leptin gene expression.

Appetite responses to high-fat diets rich in mono-unsaturated versus poly-unsaturated fats.,Polley KR; Kamal F; Paton CM; Cooper JA,"BACKGROUND: Modifying the type of dietary fat consumed may impact appetite, therefore having implications in weight management. OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of a 5-day, high-fat diet rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and a diet rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) on markers of appetite. METHODS: Fifteen normal weight men participated in a randomized cross-over design with two controlled feeding trials (3d lead-in diet, pre-diet visit, 5d PUFA- or MUFA-rich diet, post-diet visit). The 5d diets (50% fat) were rich in either PUFA (25% of energy) or MUFA (25% of energy). At pre- and post-diet visits, subjects consumed breakfast and lunch test meals, rich in the FA corresponding to the 5-day diet. Fasting and postprandial subjective ratings of appetite were determined and blood draws were performed for 4h after each meal to determine changes in appetite hormones. An ad libitum buffet meal was given at the end of pre- and post-diet visits. RESULTS: Acutely, at the pre-diet visit, the PUFA-rich meal resulted in lower ghrelin (hunger hormone) (iAUC: -350.85 ± 60.70 vs. -233.16 ± 61.42 pg/ml/8h, for PUFA vs. MUFA, respectively; p < 0.05) and higher CCK (satiation hormone) (iAUC: 238.09 ± 46.07 vs. 196.84 ± 33.92 pM/8h, for PUFA vs. MUFA, respectively; p < 0.05). No other acute meal challenge differences were found. The 5d high PUFA diet resulted in lower hunger ratings (iAUC: -172.06 ± 40.59 vs. -274.46 ± 41.47 mm/8h, for pre-to post-diet, respectively; p < 0.05). However, energy intake, ratings of fullness, or PYY did not change from pre-to post-diet for either MUFA or PUFA, and no other changes were observed with the MUFA diet.

Whole-body fat oxidation rate and plasma triacylglycerol concentrations in men consuming an ad libitum high-carbohydrate or low-carbohydrate diet.,Landry N; Bergeron N; Archer R; Samson P; Corneau L; Bergeron J; Dériaz O,"BACKGROUND: High-carbohydrate diets may increase plasma triacylglycerol concentrations either by increasing production of triacylglycerols or by reducing their clearance. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether the changes in plasma triacylglycerol concentrations induced by dietary interventions were associated with the changes in whole-body fat oxidation rates. DESIGN: In a parallel study, 37 healthy male subjects [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 28 +/- 5, age: 34 +/- 11 y (x +/- SD)] consumed an ad libitum high-carbohydrate (60% of energy; n = 19) or low-carbohydrate (46% of energy), high-fat (41% of energy, 23% as monounsaturated fatty acids; n = 18) diet for 7 wk. The following variables were measured before and after the dietary interventions: 1) plasma triacylglycerols before and 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after a meal (containing 40% of daily energy needs and 41% fat); 2) indirect calorimetry throughout the 8-h test; and 3) postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (phLPL) activity at time 8 h of the test. RESULTS: The diets induced changes in 1) body weight: -2.5 +/- 2.8 kg (P < 0.01) and -1.7 +/- 3.1 kg (P < 0.05) and 2) fasting plasma triacylglycerols: 0.0 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (NS) and -0.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (P < 0.05) for the high-carbohydrate and the low-carbohydrate diets, respectively. In normoinsulinemic subjects (fasting insulin < 100 pmol/L), dietary changes in postprandial triacylglycerols were significantly predicted by changes in phLPL, body weight, respiratory quotient (or fat oxidation), and the type of diet (stepwise multiple linear regression).

OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to examine the effects of meals enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or saturated fatty acids (SFAs) on postprandial lipid, glucose, and insulin concentrations and to examine the extent of β cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with high fasting triglyceride concentrations. DESIGN: Fourteen men with fasting hypertriglyceridemia and normal glucose tolerance were given meals (≈10 kcal/kg body weight) containing MUFAs, SFAs, or no fat. Blood samples were collected at baseline and hourly over 8 h for analysis. RESULTS: The high-fat meals significantly increased postprandial concentrations of triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, and insulin and postprandial indexes of β cell function. However, postprandial indexes of insulin sensitivity decreased significantly. These effects were significantly attenuated with MUFAs relative to SFAs. CONCLUSIONS: MUFAs postprandially buffered β cell hyperactivity and insulin intolerance relative to SFAs in subjects with high fasting triglyceride concentrations. These data suggest that, in contrast with SFAs, MUFA-based strategies may provide cardiovascular benefits to persons at risk by limiting lipid and insulin excursions and may contribute to optimal glycemic control after meal challenges.",2011,Mar,Am J Clin Nutr,93,3,494-9,,10.3945/ajcn.110.003251,21209225,#6489,Lopez 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

A randomized crossover dietary intervention study, with two diets each consumed for 14-16 days, was conducted in 18 women and 13 men aged 20-70 years, recruited via personal contacts and advertisements in newspapers. Both diets (MUFA-enriched diet and HCLF diet) contained the same basic foods and had a controlled carotenoid content, high in lycopene. The in vitro copper-induced oxidation of isolated LDL showed a longer lag phase (mean difference 7.4 min in women and 7.34 min in men) after the MUFA-enriched diet compared with the HCLF diet. Serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and carotenoid levels were similar after the two diets. Serum triacylglycerol levels were significantly lower and those of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol were significantly higher at the end of the MUFA-enriched diet compared with the HCLF diet. It is concluded that the significantly longer lag phase for oxidation of LDL, the higher HDL cholesterol level and the lower triacylglycerol level in subjects following a carotenoid-controlled, MUFA-enriched diet may decrease the risk of coronary heart disease.",2003,Sep,Clin Sci (Lond),105,3,355-61,,10.1042/CS20030050,12780345,#6494,Ahuja 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

A comparison of the influence of a high-fat diet enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids and conventional diet on weight loss and metabolic parameters in obese non-diabetic and Type 2 diabetic patients.,Brunerova L; Smejkalova V; Potockova J; Andel M,"AIMS: The aim of our study was to compare the influence of a hypocaloric, high-fat diet enriched with MUFA (M) and conventional diet (C) on weight loss and metabolic parameters in obese non-diabetic and obese Type 2 diabetic subjects over a 3-month period. It was our hypothesis that the enriched diet would be more effective in decreasing blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) than the control diet. METHODS: Twenty-seven Type 2 diabetic patients (54.5 +/- 3.5 years; DM), treated with diet or oral glucose-lowering agents, and 31 obese non-diabetic subjects (53.6 +/- 3.5 years; OB) were randomized to M or C. Individual calculations of energy requirements were based on the formula: [resting energy expenditure (REE) x 1.5] - 600 kcal. Subjects were assessed by a dietitian every 2 weeks and by a physician every month. Statistical analyses were carried out between the four groups--DM/M, DM/C, OB/M and OB/C--using pair Student's test and anova. RESULTS: After 3 months, body weight, waist-hip ratio, total body fat, levels of C-peptide, triglycerides and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) decreased in all four groups (P < 0.01). However, fasting blood glucose and HbA(1c) decreased (P < 0.01) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly only in the DM/M group (P < 0.05). In general, M was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized M and C diets were successful in improving metabolic and anthropometric parameters in both the obese non-diabetic and the Type 2 diabetic subjects. Although the superiority of the higher fat diet did not reach statistical significance, the decline in blood glucose and HbA(1c) in the Type 2 diabetic group on M was encouraging.",2007,May,Diabet Med,24,5,533-40,,10.1111/j.1464-5491.2007.02104.x,17381504,#6501,Brunerova 2007,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Diet fat saturation and feeding state modulate rates of cholesterol synthesis in normolipidemic men.,Mazier MJ; Jones PJ,"To determine whether diets differing in fats affect cholesterol synthesis in normal individuals, nine men were randomly assigned to three groups that received three diets in a crossover design for 2 wk. Diets were either monounsaturated (MONO), polyunsaturated (POLY), or saturated (SAT). Subjects then drank a dose of deuterium oxide, and unesterified cholesterol fractional synthesis rates (FSR) were calculated during consecutive fed and unfed periods. Absolute synthesis was calculated as the product of FSR and pool size, the latter obtained from a decay curve following a [4-(14)C]cholesterol injection. Serum cholesterol concentrations varied with each diet consumed (P = 0.001); the SAT diet produced the highest and the POLY diet the lowest. Triglyceride concentrations were highest when subjects consumed the SAT diet and lowest with the POLY diet (P = 0.03); values obtained with the MONO diet did not differ significantly from those seen otherwise. HDL cholesterol concentrations were lowest when the SAT diet was consumed, highest when subjects were fed the MONO diet (P = 0.05), and midway but not significantly different with the POLY diet. Cholesterol FSR were greater when subjects consumed (P = 0.001) rather than not, and FSR during 12-h periods were greater (P = 0.045) when subjects ate the POLY diet rather than the SAT diet. Absolute synthesis was also greater (P = 0.04) when subjects were fed, but did not differ with fat type (P = 0.789). Results suggest that cholesterol synthesis is greater when men are fed than when they are not fed, and reduced synthesis is not responsible for the effect of different fats on cholesterol concentrations.",1997,Feb,J Nutr,127,2,332-40,,10.1093/jn/127.2.332,9039836,#6516,Mazier 1997,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"A high-fat SFA, MUFA, or n3 PUFA challenge affects the vascular response and initiates an activated state of cellular adherence in lean and obese middle-aged men.",Esser D; van Dijk SJ; Oosterink E; Müller M; Afman LA,"BMI and fatty acid type affect postprandial metabolic TG responses, but whether these factors also affect vascular, inflammatory, and leukocyte adherence responses remains unclear. We therefore compared those postprandial responses between lean and obese men after 3 high-fat challenges differing in fatty acid composition. In a crossover double-blind study, 18 lean (BMI: 18-25 kg/m(2)) and 18 obese (BMI >29 kg/m(2)) middle-aged men received 3 isocaloric high-fat milkshakes containing 95 g fat (88% of energy), either high in SFAs (54% of energy/total fat), MUFAs (83% of energy/total fat), or n3 (omega-3) PUFAs (40% of energy/total fat). Hemodynamics, augmentation index (AIX), leukocyte cell surface adhesion markers, and plasma cytokines involved in vascular adherence, coagulation, and inflammation were measured before and after consumption of the milkshakes. In both groups and after all shakes were consumed, AIX decreased; plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM) 1, sICAM3, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM) 1, and interleukin-8 increased; monocyte CD11a, CD11b, and CD621 expression increased; neutrophil CD11a, CD11b, and CD621 expression increased; and lymphocyte CD62l expression increased (P < 0.05). Lymphocyte CD11a and CD11b expression decreased in lean participants after consumption of all shakes but did not change in obese participants (P < 0.05). Obese participants had a less pronounced decrease in heart rate after the consumption of all shakes (P < 0.05). MUFA consumption induced a more pronounced decrease in blood pressure and AIX compared with the other milkshakes in both lean and obese participants (P < 0.05). High-fat consumption initiates an activated state of cellular adherence and an atherogenic milieu. This response was independent of fatty acid type consumed or of being lean or obese, despite the clear differences in postprandial TG responses between the groups and different milkshakes. These findings suggest that in addition to increased TGs, other mechanisms are involved in the high-fat consumption-induced activated state of cellular adherence.",2013,Jun,J Nutr,143,6,843-51,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00977262,10.3945/jn.113.174540,23616512,#6518,Esser 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Should mono- or poly-unsaturated fats replace saturated fat in the diet?,Foley M; Ball M; Chisholm A; Duncan A; Spears G; Mann J,"The effects of diets differing in saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid composition (SAFA, MUFA and PUFA, respectively) on plasma lipoproteins and factor VIIc were investigated in 28 middle-aged men and women with mild to moderate hyperlipidaemia. The subjects were stabilized on a diet with a total fat content fairly typical of New Zealand, containing approximately 40% energy as fat, before entering a randomized cross-over trial of diets high in PUFA (20% energy; SAFA and MUFA 10% each) or a high MUFA diet (20% energy; SAFA and PUFA 10% each). After 6-week periods on each diet the subjects returned to a high SAFA diet. Body weight and blood pressure remained unchanged during the study. Total and LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and the HDL2 subfraction were significantly lower on both the MUFA and the PUFA diet than on SAFA. However, there were no statistically significant differences in lipoprotein concentrations on the MUFA and PUFA diet. Factor VIIc concentrations were similar on the three diets. The proportion of PUFA in a MUFA diet appears to be a major determinant of the relative lipoprotein response to such a diet. In order to avoid a reduction in HDL-C when replacing SAFA with MUFA it may be necessary to ensure that PUFA does not provide more than about 8% total energy. Thus careful planning is needed to identify the most appropriate foods to replace those rich in SAFA in diets designed to reduce the lipoprotein-mediated risk of coronary heart disease.",1992,Jun,Eur J Clin Nutr,46,6,429-36,,,1639051,#6520,Foley 1992,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Monounsaturated fatty acid-enriched diet decreases plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1.,Lopez-Segura F; Velasco F; Lopez-Miranda J; Castro P; Lopez-Pedrera R; Blanco A; Jimenez-Pereperez J; Torres A; Trujillo J; Ordovas JM; Pérez-Jiménez F,"An increase in levels of plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is one of the main hemostatic alterations in patients with coronary heart disease. Despite growing interest in the fibrinolytic system, few studies have been undertaken to determine the effect exerted on it by the different dietary fatty acids. We investigated the effect of a monounsaturated fat (MUFA)-rich diet in comparison with a low-fat diet (National Cholesterol Education Program step 1 diet) (NCEP-1) on factors involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. We also determined the effect of dietary cholesterol on these blood parameters. Twenty-one young, male, healthy volunteers followed two low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets (< 30% fat, < 10% saturated fat, 14% MUFA) for 24 days each, with 115 or 280 mg of cholesterol per 1000 kcal per day, and two oleic acid-enriched diets (38% fat, 24% MUFA) with the same dietary cholesterol as the low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets. Plasma levels of fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, prothrombin fragments 1+2, plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin, and tissue plasminogen activator were not significantly different among the experimental diets used in this study. Consumption of the diet rich in MUFA resulted in a significant decrease in both PAI-1 plasma activity (P < .005) and antigenic PAI-1 (P < .04) compared with the carbohydrate-rich diet (NCEP-1). The addition of dietary cholesterol to each of these diets did not result in any significant additional effect. Changes in insulin levels and PAI-1 activity were positively correlated (r = .425; P < .02). In conclusion, consumption of diets rich in MUFAs decreases PAI-1 plasma activity, which is accompanied by a parallel decrease in plasma insulin levels.",1996,Jan,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,16,1,82-8,,10.1161/01.atv.16.1.82,8548431,#6522,Lopez-Segura 1996,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of the Fat Eaten at Breakfast on Lipid Metabolism: A Crossover Trial in Women with Cardiovascular Risk.,Delgado-Alarcón JM; Hernández Morante JJ; Aviles FV; Albaladejo-Otón MD; Morillas-Ruíz JM,"Recent studies point out that not only the daily intake of energy and nutrients but the time of day when they are ingested notably regulates lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk (CVR). Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess if the type of fat ingested at breakfast can modify lipid metabolism in women with CVR. A randomized, crossover clinical trial was performed. Sixty volunteers were randomly assigned to a (A) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich breakfast, (B) saturated fatty acid (SFA)-rich breakfast, or (C) monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich breakfast. Plasma lipoprotein and apolipoprotein subfractions were determined. Our data showed that the PUFA-rich breakfast decreased lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and increased high-density lipoproteins (HDL). A similar trend was observed for the MUFA-rich breakfast, whereas the SFA-rich breakfast, although it decreased VLDL, also increased IDL and reduced HDL. The PUFA-rich breakfast also decreased β-lipoproteins and apolipoprotein-B. In summary, varying the type of fat eaten at breakfast is enough to significantly modify the lipid metabolism of women with CVR, which can be of great relevance to establish new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these subjects.",2020,Jun,Nutrients,12,6,,,10.3390/nu12061695,32517188,#6523,Delgado-Alarcón 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fatty acids and the risk of Parkinson disease: the Rotterdam study.,de Lau LM; Bornebroek M; Witteman JC; Hofman A; Koudstaal PJ; Breteler MM,"BACKGROUND: Unsaturated fatty acids are important constituents of neuronal cell membranes and have neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. OBJECTIVE: To determine if a high intake of unsaturated fatty acids might be associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: In the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study of people ages > or =55, the association between intake of unsaturated fatty acids and the risk of incident PD was evaluated among 5,289 subjects who were free of dementia and parkinsonism and underwent complete dietary assessment at baseline. PD was assessed through repeated in-person examination, and the cohort was continuously monitored by computer linkage to medical records. The data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 6.0 years, 51 participants with incident PD were identified. Intakes of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were significantly associated with a lower risk of PD, with an adjusted hazard ratio per SD increase of energy-adjusted intake of 0.69 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.91) for total fat, of 0.68 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.94) for MUFAs, and 0.66 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.96) for PUFAs.

Dietary fat increases vitamin D-3 absorption.,Dawson-Hughes B; Harris SS; Lichtenstein AH; Dolnikowski G; Palermo NJ; Rasmussen H,"BACKGROUND: The plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D response to supplementation with vitamin D varies widely, but vitamin D absorption differences based on diet composition is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypotheses that absorption of vitamin D-3 is greater when the supplement is taken with a meal containing fat than with a fat-free meal and that absorption is greater when the fat in the meal has a higher monounsaturated-to-polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio (MUFA:PUFA). DESIGN: Open, three-group, single-dose vitamin D-3 comparative absorption experiment. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Our 1-day study was conducted in 50 healthy older men and women who were randomly assigned to one of three meal groups: fat-free meal, and a meal with 30% of calories as fat with a low (1:4) and one with a high (4:1) MUFA:PUFA. After a 12-hour fast, all subjects took a single 50,000 IU vitamin D-3 supplement with their test breakfast meal. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma vitamin D-3 was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry before and 10, 12 (the expected peak), and 14 hours after the dose. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Means were compared with two-tailed t tests for independent samples. Group differences in vitamin D-3 absorption across the measurement time points were examined by analysis of variance with the repeated measures subcommand of the general linear models procedure. RESULTS: The mean peak (12-hour) plasma vitamin D-3 level after the dose was 32% (95% CI 11% to 52%) greater in subjects consuming fat-containing compared with fat-free meals (P=0.003). Absorption did not differ significantly at any time point in the high and low MUFA and PUFA groups.

Flow-mediated dilatation is impaired by a high-saturated fat diet but not by a high-carbohydrate diet.,Keogh JB; Grieger JA; Noakes M; Clifton PM,"OBJECTIVE: It is unknown whether a low-fat diet, which may elevate triglycerides and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, harms the endothelium. Our aim was to determine whether a low-fat, high-carbohydrate (CARB) diet impaired endothelial vasodilation compared with high saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA), or polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) diets. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty healthy subjects were randomly crossed over to 4, 3-week isocaloric diets high in PUFA, MUFA, or SFA, containing at least 25 g of the relevant fat or a low-fat, CARB, high-glycemic load diet. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), fasting blood lipids, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, plasma intercellular, and vascular adhesion molecules plasma E- and P-selectin were measured after each intervention. SFA impaired FMD compared with all other diets (5.41+/-2.45% versus 10.80+/-3.69%; P=0.01). FMD did not change on CARB relative to MUFA or PUFA, despite 23% to 39% rises in triglyceride and 10% to 15% falls in HDL cholesterol.

Dietary fatty acids and the risk of hypertension in middle-aged and older women.,Wang L; Manson JE; Forman JP; Gaziano JM; Buring JE; Sesso HD,"Dietary intake of various fats may have different effects on blood pressure. We conducted a prospective cohort study to examine the association between intake of subtype and individual fatty acids (FAs) and the risk of developing hypertension among 28 100 US women aged ≥39 years and free of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Baseline intake of FAs was assessed using semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. Incident hypertension was identified from annual follow-up questionnaires based on self-reported physician diagnosis, medication use, and blood pressure levels. A total of 13 633 women developed incident hypertension during 12.9 years of follow-up. After adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and other dietary factors, intake of saturated FAs, monounsaturated FAs, and trans-unsaturated FAs (trans FAs) was positively associated with the risk of hypertension. The multivariable relative risks and 95% CIs of hypertension in the highest compared with the lowest quintile of intake were 1.12 (1.05 to 1.20) for saturated FAs, 1.11 (1.04 to 1.18) for monounsaturated FAs, and 1.15 (1.08 to 1.22) for trans FAs. After additional adjustment for body mass index and history of diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia, these associations were attenuated and remained statistically significant only for trans FAs (relative risk in the highest quintile: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.15). Intake of polyunsaturated FAs, including ω3 and ω6 polyunsaturated FAs, was not significantly associated with the risk of hypertension.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of the interaction between variants at the ADIPOQ gene locus, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and the replacement of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or carbohydrates on serum adiponectin concentrations. DESIGN: The RISCK (Reading, Imperial, Surrey, Cambridge, and Kings) study is a parallel-design, randomized controlled trial. Serum adiponectin concentrations were measured after a 4-wk high-SFA (HS) diet and a 24-wk intervention with reference (HS), high-MUFA (HM), and low-fat (LF) diets. Single nucleotide polymorphisms at the ADIPOQ locus -11391 G/A (rs17300539), -10066 G/A (rs182052), -7734 A/C (rs16861209), and +276 G/T (rs1501299) were genotyped in 448 participants. RESULTS: In white Europeans, +276 T was associated with higher serum adiponectin concentrations (n = 340; P = 0.006) and -10066 A was associated with lower serum adiponectin concentrations (n = 360; P = 0.03), after adjustment for age, BMI, and sex.

Diets high and low in glycemic index versus high monounsaturated fat diets: effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in NIDDM.,Luscombe ND; Noakes M; Clifton PM,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative effects of high and low glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates, and monounsaturated fats on blood glucose and lipid metabolism in NIDDM subjects. SUBJECTS: Fourteen male and seven female variably controlled NIDDM subjects recruited by advertisement. SETTING: Free living outpatients. RESEARCH DESIGN: A repeated measures, within-subject design was used such that each subject consumed three diets: (a) a high-GI diet (53% CHO -21% fat, 63 GI units (glucose= 100)); (b) a low-GI diet (51% CHO -23% fat, 43 GI units); and (c) a high-mono high-GI diet (42% CHO -35% fat, 59 GI units) in random order and cross-over fashion for four weeks. Approximately 45% energy was provided as key foods which differed in published GI values and specifically excluded legumes. Dietary fibre intake was > 30 g/d on each diet. At the end of each dietary intervention, we measured fasting plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, total glycated plasma protein, fructosamine, LDL and HDL particle size as well as 24 h urinary excretion of glucose and C-peptide. RESULTS: HDL-cholesterol was higher on the low-GI and high-mono high-GI diets compared to the high-GI diet (P < 0.05 for overall diet effect). There were no other significant differences in metabolic control between diets, even when adjusted for BMI, glucose control or gender.

Lower habitual intakes of SFAs, however, require substitution of other macronutrients to maintain energy balance. OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations between energy intake from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and carbohydrates and risk of CHD while assessing the potential effect-modifying role of sex and age. Using substitution models, our aim was to clarify whether energy from unsaturated fatty acids or carbohydrates should replace energy from SFAs to prevent CHD. DESIGN: This was a follow-up study in which data from 11 American and European cohort studies were pooled. The outcome measure was incident CHD. RESULTS: During 4-10 y of follow-up, 5249 coronary events and 2155 coronary deaths occurred among 344,696 persons. For a 5% lower energy intake from SFAs and a concomitant higher energy intake from PUFAs, there was a significant inverse association between PUFAs and risk of coronary events (hazard ratio: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.97); the hazard ratio for coronary deaths was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.89). For a 5% lower energy intake from SFAs and a concomitant higher energy intake from carbohydrates, there was a modest significant direct association between carbohydrates and coronary events (hazard ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.14); the hazard ratio for coronary deaths was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.13). MUFA intake was not associated with CHD. No effect modification by sex or age was found. CONCLUSION: The associations suggest that replacing SFAs with PUFAs rather than MUFAs or carbohydrates prevents CHD over a wide range of intakes.",2009,May,Am J Clin Nutr,89,5,1425-32,,10.3945/ajcn.2008.27124,19211817,#6576,Jakobsen 2009,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
National Diet and Nutrition Survey: fat and fatty acid intake from the first year of the rolling programme and comparison with previous surveys.,Pot GK; Prynne CJ; Roberts C; Olson A; Nicholson SK; Whitton C; Teucher B; Bates B; Henderson H; Pigott S; Swan G; Stephen AM,"High saturated fat intake is an established risk factor for several chronic diseases. The objective of the present study is to report dietary intakes and main food sources of fat and fatty acids (FA) from the first year of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) rolling programme in the UK. Dietary data were collected using 4 d estimated food diaries (n 896) and compared with dietary reference values (DRV) and previous NDNS results. Total fat provided 34-36 % food energy (FE) across all age groups, which was similar to previous surveys for adults. Men (19-64 years) and older girls (11-18 years) had mean intakes just above the DRV, while all other groups had mean total fat intakes of < 35 % FE. SFA intakes were lower compared with previous surveys, ranging from 13 to 15 % FE, but still above the DRV. Mean MUFA intakes were 12·5 % FE for adults and children aged 4-18 years and all were below the DRV. Mean n-3 PUFA intake represented 0·7-1·1 % FE. Compared with previous survey data, the direction of change for n-3 PUFA was upwards for all age groups, although the differences in absolute terms were very small. Trans-FA intakes were lower than in previous NDNS and were less than 2 g/d for all age groups, representing 0·8 % FE and lower than the DRV in all age groups. In conclusion, dietary intake of fat and FA is moving towards recommended levels for the UK population.

Adding MUFA to a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods reduces apoAI fractional catabolic rate in subjects with dyslipidaemia.,Labonté MÈ; Jenkins DJ; Lewis GF; Chiavaroli L; Wong JM; Kendall CW; Hogue JC; Couture P; Lamarche B,"The present randomised parallel study assessed the impact of adding MUFA to a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods on the intravascular kinetics of apoAI- and apoB-containing lipoproteins in subjects with dyslipidaemia. A sample of sixteen men and postmenopausal women consumed a run-in stabilisation diet for 4 weeks. Subjects were then randomly assigned to an experimental dietary portfolio either high or low in MUFA for another 4 weeks. MUFA substituted 13·0% of total energy from carbohydrate (CHO) in the high-MUFA dietary portfolio. Lipoprotein kinetics were assessed after the run-in and portfolio diets using a primed, constant infusion of [2H3]leucine and multicompartmental modelling. The high-MUFA dietary portfolio resulted in higher apoAI pool size (PS) compared with the low-MUFA dietary portfolio (15·9% between-diet difference, P¼0·03). This difference appeared to be mainly attributable to a reduction in apoAI fractional catabolic rate (FCR) after the high-MUFA diet (25·6%, P¼0·02 v. pre-diet values), with no significant change in production rate. The high-MUFA dietary portfolio tended to reduce LDL apoB100 PS compared with the low-MUFA dietary portfolio (228·5% between-diet that adding MUFA to a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods provides the added advantage of raising HDL primarily through a reduction in HDL clearance rate.

"Low-fat and high-monounsaturated fatty acid diets decrease plasma cholesterol ester transfer protein concentrations in young, healthy, normolipemic men.",Jansen S; López-Miranda J; Castro P; López-Segura F; Marín C; Ordovás JM; Paz E; Jiménez-Perepérez J; Fuentes F; Pérez-Jiménez F,"BACKGROUND: Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins. The possible atherogenic role of this protein is controversial. Diet may influence plasma CETP concentrations. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether the changes in plasma lipids observed after consumption of 2 lipid-lowering diets are associated with changes in plasma CETP concentrations. DESIGN: : We studied 41 healthy, normolipidemic men over 3 consecutive 4-wk dietary periods: a saturated fatty acid-rich diet (SFA diet: 38% fat, 20% saturated fat), a National Cholesterol Education Program Step I diet (NCEP Step I diet: 28% fat, 10% saturated fat), and a monounsaturated fatty acid-rich diet (MUFA diet: 38% fat, 22% monounsaturated fat). Cholesterol content (27.5 mg/MJ) was kept constant during the 3 periods. Plasma concentrations of total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; triacylglycerol; apo A-I and B; and CETP were measured at the end of each dietary period. RESULTS: Compared with the SFA diet, both lipid-lowering diets significantly decreased plasma total and LDL cholesterol, apo B, and CETP. Only the NCEP Step I diet lowered plasma HDL cholesterol. Positive, significant correlations were found between plasma CETP and total (r = 0.3868, P < 0.0001) and LDL (r = 0.4454, P < 0.0001) cholesterol and also between changes in CETP concentrations and those of total (r = 0.4543, P < 0.0001) and LDL (r = 0.4554, P < 0.0001) cholesterol.

Influence of apolipoprotein-E phenotypes on postprandial lipoprotein metabolism after three different fat loads.,Fernández-Miranda C; Cancelas P; Sanz M; Porres A; Gámez Gerique J,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the postprandial response to three fat-loading tests in healthy subjects with different apolipoprotein E (apoE) phenotypes. Thirty-four subjects were studied: 15 with apoE3/3 (7 men and 8 women), 12 with apoE4/3 (5 men and 7 women), and 7 with apoE2/3 (4 men and 3 women). All received three oral fat loads at 1-wk intervals in meals rich in monounsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and saturated fatty acid, with retinyl palmitate (60000 IU/m(2) of aqueous vitamin A) to quantify lipoproteins secreted by the intestine. No significant differences in postprandial lipoproteins were found between the three different fat loads. Peaks and incremental areas under the curve of retinyl palmitate in non-chylomicron fractions were higher in the apoE2/3- than in the apoE3/3- and apoE4/3-phenotype groups in meals rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (P < 0.05). When the three fat loads were analyzed together, the incremental area under the curve of retinyl palmitate was much higher in the apoE2/3- than in the other apoE-phenotype groups (P = 0.0004).

Plasma lipid response to hypolipidemic diets in young healthy non-obese men varies with body mass index.,Jansen S; Lopez-Miranda J; Salas J; Castro P; Paniagua JA; Lopez-Segura F; Ordovas JM; Jimenez-Pereperez JA; Blanco A; Perez-Jimenez F,"Lipid response to dietary fat is highly variable among individuals of a population. The aim of this study was to establish whether being overweight is one of the factors that determines this response. Forty-one non-obese healthy men were divided into two groups according to body mass index as follows: controls, <25 kg/m2; overweight, >25 kg/m2 but <30 kg/m2. After consuming a saturated fat-rich diet (SAT diet: 38% fat, 20% saturated) for 4 wk, subjects were switched to a low fat diet [National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-I diet: 28% fat, 10% saturated] for 4 wk and then to a monounsaturated fat-rich diet (MUFA diet: 38% fat, 22% monounsaturated) for 4 wk. Data were analyzed by Student's t test and two-way ANOVA for repeated measures. After consuming the NCEP-I diet, the overweight subjects had a smaller decrease relative to the SAT diet period in plasma total cholesterol [-0.30 vs. -0.67 mmol/L (-7 vs. -16%), P < 0.02] and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations [-0.24 vs. -0.55 mmol/L (-9 vs. -21%), P < 0.04] than controls. However, in the overweight subjects, the MUFA diet produced a greater decrease in plasma triglycerides than in the controls relative to the SAT diet period [-0.36 vs. -0.03 mmol/L (-26 vs. -4%), P < 0.006] and to the NCEP-I diet period [-0.29 vs. 0. 01 mmol/L (-22 vs. 1%), P < 0.01). Plasma cholesterol concentrations changed to a lesser extent, and triglyceride concentration to a greater extent, in overweight but non-obese young men than in those of normal weight in response to changes in dietary fat composition.

However, in most patients, the clinical expression of the disease could be prevented by dietary and lifestyle changes. We investigated the effects of a diet enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (Mediterranean diet) and a low fat, high-carbohydrate diet on in vivo and in vitro glucose metabolism in 59 young subjects (30 men and 29 women). METHODS: We carried out an intervention dietary study with a saturated fat phase and two randomized-crossover dietary periods: a high-carbohydrate diet and a Mediterranean diet for 28 days each. We analysed the plasma lipoproteins fractions, free fatty acids, insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in isolated monocytes at the end of the three dietary periods. RESULTS: In comparison to the saturated fat diet, the CHO and Mediterranean diets induced a decrease of LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001) and HDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001). Steady-state plasma glucose decreased (p = 0.023) and basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxiglucose uptake in peripheral monocytes increased in both diets (CHO and Mediterranean), (p = 0.007) indicating an improvement in insulin sensitivity.

The influence of high-protein (HP) versus high-monounsaturated fat (HMF) meals on postprandial lipids, lipoprotein particle numbers, cytokines, and leptin responses in overweight/obese (OW/O) subjects is unknown. METHODS: Twenty-four OW/O participants consumed an HP (31.9% energy from protein) and HMF (35.2% fat and 20.7% monounsaturated fat) meal, of similar energy/carbohydrate content, in a random order. The outcome variables were assessed from blood samples collected in fasted and postprandial (3 hr) states. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis found significant (P < 0.05) meal condition by time interactions for triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein particles (VLDLP), total high-density lipoprotein particles (T-HDLP), and the ratio of large-buoyant high-density lipoprotein 2b (LB-HDL2b) to T-HDLP, and meal effect on small-dense HDLP (SD-HDLP).

Mediterranean diet reduces endothelial damage and improves the regenerative capacity of endothelium.,Marin C; Ramirez R; Delgado-Lista J; Yubero-Serrano EM; Perez-Martinez P; Carracedo J; Garcia-Rios A; Rodriguez F; Gutierrez-Mariscal FM; Gomez P; Perez-Jimenez F; Lopez-Miranda J,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is a fundamental step in the atherosclerotic disease process. Activation or injury of the endothelium leads to a variety of inflammatory disorders, including the release of microparticles. Endothelial progenitor cells may contribute to the maintenance of the endothelium by replacing injured mature endothelial cells. OBJECTIVE: We studied the influence of dietary fat on the release of endothelial microparticles (EMPs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in elderly subjects. DESIGN: Twenty healthy, elderly subjects (10 men and 10 women) consumed 3 diets following a randomized crossover design, each for 4 wk: a saturated fatty acid diet; a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet; and a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids. We investigated total microparticles, EMPs from activated endothelial cells (activated EMPs), EMPs from apoptotic endothelial cells (apoptotic EMPs), EPCs, oxidative stress variables, and ischemic reactive hyperemia (IRH). RESULTS: The MedDiet led to lower total microparticle, activated EMP, and apoptotic EMP concentrations and higher EPC numbers than did the other diets (P < 0.001). We detected lower superoxide dismutase activity (P < 0.001), a higher plasma β-carotene concentration (P < 0.001), and lower urinary isoprostane and plasma nitrotyrosine concentrations after consumption of the MedDiet than after consumption of the other 2 diets (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the occurrence of IRH was higher after consumption of the MedDiet than after consumption of the other 2 diets (P < 0.05).

Beneficial effects of increasing monounsaturated fat intake in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,Donaghue KC; Pena MM; Chan AK; Blades BL; King J; Storlien LH; Silink M,"This study aimed to increase the monounsaturated fat content in the diet of outpatient adolescents with type 1 diabetes and to examine the metabolic effects after 12 weeks. Twenty-three adolescents were randomly allocated to either a high monounsaturated fat diet or a control diet. Their mean age was 16.9 (S.D. 2.1) years and median HbA(1c) was 9.1% [IQR 7.9-10.4%]. Dietary targets were not reached judged by their 4-day food diaries. However, the whole study group had a significant increase in monounsaturated fat as indexed by red cell phospholipid fatty acids (RCFAs), with an increase of n-9 RCFAs from 14.9% [IQR: 14.5-21.7%] to 21.7% [IQR: 18.8-25.6%] (P=0.002). Changes in n-9 RCFAs were inversely related to changes in HbA(1c) (R(2)=0.26, P=0.02), such that a 10% increase in n-9 RCFAs corresponded to a 0.64% improvement (decrease) in HbA(1c). Changes in n-9 RCFAs were also inversely related to changes in plasma total cholesterol (R(2)=0.38, P=0.002) and plasma LDL cholesterol (R(2)=0. 21, P=0.03).

High carbohydrate and high monounsaturated fatty acid diets similarly affect LDL electrophoretic characteristics in men who are losing weight.,Archer WR; Lamarche B; St-Pierre AC; Mauger JF; Dériaz O; Landry N; Corneau L; Després JP; Bergeron J; Couture P; Bergeron N,"We compared the effects of ad libitum consumption of a defined high complex carbohydrate (CHO) diet (% of energy: CHO, 58.3; fat, 25.8) vs. a defined high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diet (% of energy: CHO, 44.7; fat, 40.1; MUFA, 22.5) on LDL electrophoretic characteristics. Healthy men [n = 65; age, 37.5 +/- 11.2 (mean +/- SD) y; BMI, 29.2 +/- 4.9 kg/m2] were randomly assigned to one of the two diets that they consumed for 6-7 wk. The high CHO diet significantly reduced body weight (-2%). The diet-induced reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol (C) levels in the high-CHO diet group was due mainly to concurrent reductions in the cholesterol content of small (<25.5 nm, P < 0.01) and medium-sized LDL (25.5-26.0 nm, P = 0.01). The high MUFA diet also reduced body weight, and LDL-C and LDL-apolipoprotein (apo)B levels, which were comparable to those in the high CHO group. The cholesterol levels of small LDL particles tended to be reduced (P = 0.24) in the high MUFA group (-12%), similar to changes in the high CHO group. These results suggest that, when associated with weight loss, ad libitum consumption of high CHO and high MUFA diets may be considered to be equally beneficial for the management of LDL-related atherogenic dyslipidemia. However, the high MUFA diet more favorably affected triglyceride levels, suggesting that it may be preferable to a high CHO diet in cardiovascular disease prevention.",2003,Oct,J Nutr,133,10,3124-9,,10.1093/jn/133.10.3124,14519795,#6663,Archer 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

We have examined the response to dietary fat saturation as a function of this mutation in 50 men and women. Subjects were first fed a saturated (SAT) fat diet (35% fat, 17% SAT) for 28 days, followed by a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty (MUFA) acids (35% fat, 22% MUFA) for 35 days and a diet rich in polyunsaturated (PUFA) fat (35% fat, 13% PUFA) for 35 days. All meals were prepared and consumed at the study sites. Lipoproteins were measured at the end of each diet period. The allele frequency for the A allele was 0.13. Subjects carrying the A allele had higher plasma cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride levels than those homozygotes for the G allele. As compared to the SAT diet, a PUFA diet induced significantly greater plasma total (P = 0.003) and LDL-C decreases (P = 0.001) in G/A women (-1.62 and -1.32 mmol/l, respectively) than in G/G subjects (-0.87 and -0.74 mmol/l for plasma and LDL-C, respectively). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that in women, the variability in LDL-C response from a diet rich in SAT fat to a diet rich in PUFA was primarily due to LDL-C levels (during the SAT phase), accounting for 55.1% of the variance, waist to hip ratio (W/H; 11.4%) and the G/A polymorphism (10%). Whereas in men the major determinant of this response was smoking (21.4%). In conclusion, the G/A polymorphism appears to have a small but significant effect on plasma LDL-C responsiveness to changes in dietary fat saturation specially in women.",1998,Apr,Atherosclerosis,137,2,367-76,,10.1016/s0021-9150(97)00265-7,9622280,#6676,Mata 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of varying carbohydrate content of diet in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,Garg A; Bantle JP; Henry RR; Coulston AM; Griver KA; Raatz SK; Brinkley L; Chen YD; Grundy SM; Huet BA; et al.,"OBJECTIVE: To study effects of variation in carbohydrate content of diet on glycemia and plasma lipoproteins in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). DESIGN: A four-center randomized crossover trial. SETTING: Outpatient and inpatient evaluation in metabolic units. PATIENTS: Forty-two NIDDM patients receiving glipizide therapy. INTERVENTIONS: A high-carbohydrate diet containing 55% of the total energy as carbohydrates and 30% as fats was compared with a high-monounsaturated-fat diet containing 40% carbohydrates and 45% fats. The amounts of saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, cholesterol, sucrose, and protein were similar. The study diets, prepared in metabolic kitchens, were provided as the sole nutrients to subjects for 6 weeks each. To assess longer-term effects, a subgroup of 21 patients continued the diet they received second for an additional 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, lipoproteins, and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations. Twenty-four-hour profiles of glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels. RESULTS: The site of study as well as the diet order did not affect the results. Compared with the high-monounsaturated-fat diet, the high-carbohydrate diet increased fasting plasma triglyceride levels and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 24% (P < .0001) and 23% (P = .0001), respectively, and increased daylong plasma triglyceride, glucose, and insulin values by 10% (P = .03), 12% (P < .0001), and 9% (P = .02), respectively. Plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels remained unchanged. The effects of both diets on plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels persisted for 14 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: In NIDDM patients, high-carbohydrate diets compared with high-monounsaturated-fat diets caused persistent deterioration of glycemic control and accentuation of hyperinsulinemia, as well as increased plasma triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, which may not be desirable.",1994,May,JAMA,271,18,1421-8,,10.1001/jama.1994.03510420053034,7848401,#6688,Garg 1994,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The association of substituting carbohydrates with total fat and different types of fatty acids with mortality and weight change among diabetes patients.,Campmans-Kuijpers MJ; Sluijs I; Nöthlings U; Freisling H; Overvad K; Boeing H; Masala G; Panico S; Tumino R; Sieri S; Johansson I; Winkvist A; Katzke VA; Kuehn T; Nilsson PM; Halkjær J; Tjønneland A; Spijkerman AM; Arriola L; Sacerdote C; Barricarte A; May AM; Beulens JW,"BACKGROUND: Substitution of carbohydrates with fat in a diet for type 2 diabetes patients is still debated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary carbohydrate intake and isocaloric substitution with (i) total fat, (ii) saturated fatty acids (SFA), (iii) mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and (iv) poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality risk and 5-year weight change in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The study included 6192 patients with type 2 diabetes from 15 cohorts of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Dietary intake was assessed at recruitment with country-specific food-frequency questionnaires. Cox and linear regression were used to estimate the associations with (CVD) mortality and weight change, adjusting for confounders and using different methods to adjust for energy intake. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 9.2 y ± SD 2.3 y, 791 (13%) participants had died, of which 268 (4%) due to CVD. Substituting 10 g or 5 energy% of carbohydrates by total fat was associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.07 [1.02-1.13]), or SFAs (HR 1.25 [1.11-1.40]) and a lower risk when replaced by MUFAs (HR 0.89 [0.77-1.02]). When carbohydrates were substituted with SFAs (HR 1.22 [1.00-1.49]) or PUFAs (HR 1.29 [1.02-1.63]) CVD mortality risk increased. The 5-year weight was lower when carbohydrates were substituted with total fat or MUFAs. These results were consistent over different energy adjustment methods. CONCLUSIONS: In diabetes patients, substitution of carbohydrates with SFAs was associated with a higher (CVD) mortality risk and substitution by total fat was associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk. Substitution of carbohydrates with MUFAs may be associated with lower mortality risk and weight reduction. Instead of promoting replacement of carbohydrates by total fat, dietary guideline should continue focusing on replacement by fat-subtypes; especially SFAs by MUFAs.",2016,Oct,Clin Nutr,35,5,1096-102,,10.1016/j.clnu.2015.08.003,26342536,#6693,Campmans-Kuijpers 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Circulating levels of endothelial function are modulated by dietary monounsaturated fat.,Pérez-Jiménez F; Castro P; López-Miranda J; Paz-Rojas E; Blanco A; López-Segura F; Velasco F; Marín C; Fuentes F; Ordovás JM,"BACKGROUND: For the most part, the benefits of monounsaturated-rich diets (MUFA-diet) have been related to their action on plasma lipid levels. However other non-lipidic effects could also be involved in their protective effects. One of these involves the decrease in plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), the main inhibitor of fibrinolysis. Given that the PAI-1 is of endothelial origin, one hypothesis is that the MUFA-diet could protect against CHD by modulating some endothelial components. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male subjects (n = 25) received three different consecutive diets, each lasting 28 days: a low fat NCEP-I-diet, with 28% calories as fat, 10% saturated fat (SAT), 12% monounsaturated (MUFA) and 6% polyunsaturated (PUFA); a MUFA-diet, with 38% calories as fat, 10% SAT, 22% MUFA and 6% PUFA; and a SAT rich-diet (SAT-diet), with 38% calories as fat, 20% SAT, 12% MUFA and 6% PUFA. After each dietary period, the plasma lipid profile was determined, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total triglyceride, apo A1, apo B plasma levels and conjugated diene formation, after incubation of LDL particles with Cu 5 microM/l. Endothelial products measured in plasma were von Willebrand factor (vWF), E-selectin, Thrombomodulin and Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) levels. We observed a decrease in vWF, PAI-1 and TFPI plasma levels and an increase in lag time of conjugated diene formation after the MUFA-diet. There was a positive correlation between the decreases in TFPI and vWF and the changes in total cholesterol, LDL-C, apo B plasma levels. The decrease in TFPI was negatively correlated with the increase in lag time of conjugated diene formation. PAI-1 plasma levels were positively correlated with total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides and negatively correlated with HDL-C. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of a Mediterranean-type MUFA-diet produces a decrease in plasma levels of vWF, TFPI and PAI-1 plasma levels in young healthy males. Given that these substances are of endothelial origin, one could suggest that the MUFA of the diet has a beneficial effect on endothelial function resulting in protective changes against thrombogenesis.",1999,Aug,Atherosclerosis,145,2,351-8,,10.1016/s0021-9150(99)00116-1,10488963,#6694,Pérez-Jiménez 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Diet and risk of dementia: Does fat matter?: The Rotterdam Study.,Engelhart MJ; Geerlings MI; Ruitenberg A; Van Swieten JC; Hofman A; Witteman JC; Breteler MM,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether high intake of total fat, saturated fatty acids (saturated fat), trans fatty acids (trans fat), and cholesterol and low intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), n-6 PUFA, and n-3 PUFA are associated with increased risk of dementia and its subtypes. METHOD: Data from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective cohort study among elderly, were used. At baseline (1990 to 1993), 5,395 subjects had normal cognition, were noninstitutionalized, and underwent complete dietary assessment by a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. The cohort was continuously monitored for incident dementia, and re-examinations were performed in 1993 to 1994 and 1997 to 1999. The association between fat intake and incident dementia was examined by Cox's proportional hazards models. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 6.0 years, 197 subjects developed dementia (146 AD, 29 vascular dementia). High intake of total, saturated, trans fat, and cholesterol and low intake of MUFA, PUFA, n-6 PUFA, and n-3 PUFA were not associated with increased risk of dementia or its subtypes. Rate ratios of dementia per standard deviation increase in intake were for total fat 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07), for saturated fat 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.05), for trans fat 0.90 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.06), for cholesterol 0.93 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.08), for MUFA 0.96 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.10), for PUFA 1.05 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.38), for n-6 PUFA 1.03 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.36), and for n-3 PUFA 1.07 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.22).

Dietary fat intake and the risk of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly.,Martínez-Ramírez MJ; Palma S; Martínez-González MA; Delgado-Martínez AD; de la Fuente C; Delgado-Rodríguez M,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between fat intake, serum lipids and the risk of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. DESIGN: A hospital-based case-control study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a tertiary centre and referral hospital for the province of Jaén (Spain). SUBJECTS: Cases (n=167) were patients aged 65 years or more with a low-energy fracture selected from the population attended at the hospital. Controls (patients without antecedents of any fracture) were 1:1 matched to cases by sex and age (n=167). METHODS: Diet was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Serum total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were also measured. RESULTS: Participants in the two upper quartiles of polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) intake showed an increased risk of fracture, with statistically significant differences with respect to the first quartile in the adjusted model (odds ratio (OR)=3.59; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.06-12.1 and OR=5.88; 95% CI=1.38-25.02); P=0.01 for the trend test). A higher ratio of monounsaturated fat (MUFA) to PUFA was associated with a reduced risk of fracture (OR=0.20; 95% CI=0.07-0.60 for the fourth quartile; P=0.002 for the trend test). The intake of omega-6 fatty acids was associated with an elevated risk of fracture (OR=3.41; 95% CI=1.05-11.15 for the fourth quartile; P=0.01 for the trend test). HDL-cholesterol levels were inversely associated with the risk of fracture (test for trend P=0.03 across quartiles).

The effect of quality and amount of dietary fat on the susceptibility of low density lipoprotein to oxidation in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.,Schwab US; Sarkkinen ES; Lichtenstein AH; Li Z; Ordovas JM; Schaefer EJ; Uusitupa MI,"OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of a high fat diet rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA-diet) and a moderate fat diet rich in polyunsaturated fat (PUFA-diet) on the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. SUBJECTS: 29 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: After consuming a run-in diet [37% of energy (E%) fat, 18 E% saturated fat] for three weeks, subjects were randomly assigned either to a MUFA-diet (40 E% fat, 19 E% monounsaturated fatty acids) or a PUFA-diet (34 E% fat, 10 E% polyunsaturated fat) for eight weeks. The susceptibility of LDL to oxidation was measured by challenging LDL with hemin and H2O2 and measuring the time for the reaction to reach maximum velocity. Results are expressed as lag time to oxidation in minutes. RESULTS: In the PUFA-diet group (n = 15) lag time tended to decrease during the experimental diet (97 +/- 28 vs 90 +/- 25 min, mean +/- s.d., P = 0.073), whereas in the MUFA-diet group (n = 14) there was no significant change (lag time 96 +/- 24 vs 100 +/- 16 min, P = 0.408). The mean change in lag time was -7 +/- 14 min (-7.2%) in the PUFA-diet group and +4 +/- 16 min (+4.0%) in the MUFA-diet group (P = 0.029, PUFA-diet group vs MUFA-diet group). The alpha-tocopherol concentration in LDL increased significantly (P < 0.01) in both diet groups relative to the run-in diet period, but LDL particle score did not change in either of the diet groups during the dietary intervention. In subjects with impaired glucose tolerance a PUFA-rich diet with a moderate amount of fat tended to increase the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation as compared to a higher fat diet rich in MUFA. Furthermore, the negative mean change in lag time to oxidation found in the PUFA-diet group differed significantly from the slightly positive mean change found in the MUFA-diet group.",1998,Jun,Eur J Clin Nutr,52,6,452-8,,10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600587,9683400,#6706,Schwab 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary intake of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids is related to the reduced risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,Tang YX; Zhao W; Li J; Xie P; Wang S; Yan L; Xing X; Lu J; Tse LA; Wang HH; Liu X,"BACKGROUND: The relationship of consumption of dietary fat and fatty acids with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship of dietary fat and fatty acids intake with ESCC risk. METHODS: This case-control study included 879 incident cases and 892 community-based controls recruited from Southwest China. A food frequency questionnaire was adopted to collect information about dietary information, and intake of fat, saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and total fatty acid (TFA) was calculated. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using the logistic regression model. RESULTS: When comparing the highest with lowest intake quintiles, MUFA (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.21-0.51), PUFA (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.20-0.51), and TFA (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28-0.70) were related to a reduced risk of ESCC after adjusting for confounders; for non-drinkers rather than drinkers, the intake of SFA was significantly related to a 61% (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.19-0.81) reduced risk of ESCC when comparing the highest with the lowest intake quintiles. Dietary fat was not related to the risk of ESCC. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the more intake of MUFA and PUFA, the lower risk of ESCC, whereas the protective effect of TFA was only observed among non-drinkers.

The insulin sensitivity response is determined by the interaction between the G972R polymorphism of the insulin receptor substrate 1 gene and dietary fat.,Marín C; Pérez-Martínez P; Delgado-Lista J; Gómez P; Rodríguez F; Yubero-Serrano EM; García-Ríos A; Camargo A; Pérez-Jiménez F; López-Miranda J,"SCOPE: Insulin resistance, a condition associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, results from the interaction of environmental and genetic factors. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of the G972R polymorphism at the insulin receptor substrate 1 gene on insulin sensitivity in a healthy young population. Furthermore, we examined whether the presence of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; GR or GG) interacts with dietary fat to modulate insulin sensitivity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-nine healthy volunteers consumed three diets during 4 wk each following a randomized crossover design: a saturated fatty acid diet, a low-fat and high carbohydrate (CHO) diet or a MUFA diet. For each diet, we investigated peripheral insulin sensitivity with the insulin suppression test. Steady-state plasma glucose and plasma-free fatty acids concentrations were significantly lower in GR subjects after the intake of a CHO diet, than did homozygous GG subjects (p<0.05). However, no differences were observed after consuming the two other diets. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin sensitivity increased in GR subjects for the G972R polymorphism at the insulin receptor substrate 1 gene locus, after intake of a CHO diet.

Distinctive postprandial modulation of beta cell function and insulin sensitivity by dietary fats: monounsaturated compared with saturated fatty acids.,López S; Bermúdez B; Pacheco YM; Villar J; Abia R; Muriana FJ,"BACKGROUND: Exaggerated and prolonged postprandial triglyceride concentrations are associated with numerous conditions related to insulin resistance, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. Although dietary fats profoundly affect postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, limited data exist regarding their effects on postprandial glucose homeostasis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether postprandial glucose homeostasis is modulated distinctly by high-fat meals enriched in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). DESIGN: Normotriglyceridemic subjects with normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance were studied. Blood samples were collected over the 8 h after ingestion of a glucose and triglyceride tolerance test meal (GTTTM) in which a panel of dietary fats with a gradual change in the ratio of MUFAs to SFAs was included. On 5 separate occasions, basal and postprandial concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and free fatty acids (FFAs) were measured. RESULTS: High-fat meals increased the postprandial concentrations of insulin, triglycerides, and FFAs, and they enhanced postprandial beta cell function while decreasing insulin sensitivity (as assessed with different model-based and empirical indexes: insulinogenic index, insulinogenic index/homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, area under the curve for insulin/area under the curve for glucose, homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function, and GTTTM-determined insulin sensitivity, oral glucose insulin sensitivity, and the postprandial Belfiore indexes for glycemia and blood FFAs. These effects were significantly ameliorated, in a direct linear relation, when MUFAs were substituted for SFAs.

Following an 8-week LED and a 2-3-week refeeding period, 131 subjects were randomized to three diets for 6 months: MUFA, moderate-fat (35-45 energy percentage (E%) fat), high in MUFA with low glycaemic index; LF, low fat (20-30 E% fat) or CTR, control (35 E% fat). A meal test study was performed in a subgroup, before and after the 6-month dietary intervention, with forty-two subjects completing both meal tests. No difference in body weight, energy intake or appetite ratings were observed between diets. Both the LF and MUFA diets compared to CTR diet reduced postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia and lowered fasting insulin from month 0 to month 6. Following the 8-week LED period lower levels of the appetite regulating peptides, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide YY, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon-like peptide-2, along with increased appetite scores were seen in comparison to measurements performed after the 6-month dietary intervention. In conclusion, the two competing diets, MUFA and LF, were equally good with respect to glucose metabolism, whereas the CTR diet resembling the typical Western diet, high in SFA, sugar and high glycaemic carbohydrates, indicated associations to lowering of insulin sensitivity.

The effect of replacing dietary saturated fat with polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat on plasma lipids in free-living young adults.,Hodson L; Skeaff CM; Chisholm WA,"OBJECTIVE: To examine, in free-living adults eating self-selected diets, the effects on plasma cholesterol of substituting saturated fat rich foods with either n-6 polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat rich foods while at the same time adhering to a total fat intake of 30-33% of dietary energy. DESIGN: Two randomised crossover trials. SETTING: General community. SUBJECTS: Volunteer sample of healthy free-living nutrition students at the University of Otago. Trial I, n=29; and trial II, n=42. INTERVENTIONS: In trials I and II participants were asked to follow for 2(1/2) weeks a diet high in saturated fat yet with a total fat content that conformed to nutrition recommendations (30-33% energy). During the 2(1/2) week comparison diet, saturated fat rich foods were replaced with foods rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fats (trial I) whereas in trial II the replacement foods were rich in monounsaturated fats. Participants were asked to maintain a total fat intake of 30-33% of energy on all diets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Energy and nutrient intakes, plasma triglyceride fatty acids, and plasma cholesterol. RESULTS: When replacing saturated fat with either n-6 polyunsaturated fat or monounsaturated fat, total fat intakes decreased by 2.9% energy and 5.1% energy, respectively. Replacing saturated fat with n-6 polyunsaturated fat (trial I) lowered plasma total cholesterol by 19% [from 4.87 (0.88) to 3.94 (0.92) mmol/l, mean (s.d.)], low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 22% [from 2.87 (0.75) to 2.24 (0.67) mmol/l], and high density lipoprotein cholesterol by 14% [from 1.39 (0.36) to 1.19 (0.34) mmol/l], whereas replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat (trial II) decreased total cholesterol by 12%, low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 15%, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol by 4%, respectively. The change in the ratio of total to high density lipoprotein cholesterol was similar during trial I and trial II. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults are very responsive to dietary-induced changes in plasma cholesterol even when an isocaloric replacement of saturated fat with n-6 polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat is not achieved. Replacing saturated fat with either n-6 polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat is equally efficacious at reducing the total to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio.

"The amount and types of fatty acids acutely affect insulin, glycemic and gastrointestinal peptide responses but not satiety in metabolic syndrome subjects.",Chang CY; Kanthimathi MS; Tan AT; Nesaretnam K; Teng KT,"PURPOSE: Limited clinical evidence is available on the effects of amount and types of dietary fats on postprandial insulinemic and gastrointestinal peptide responses in metabolic syndrome subjects. We hypothesized that meals enriched with designated: (1) amount of fats (50 vs 20 g), (2) fats with differing fatty acid composition (saturated, SFA; monounsaturated, MUFA or n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, PUFA) would affect insulinemic and gastrointestinal peptide releases in metabolic syndrome subjects. METHODS: Using a randomized, crossover and double-blinded design, 15 men and 15 women with metabolic syndrome consumed high-fat meals enriched with SFA, MUFA or n-6 PUFA, or a low-fat/high-sucrose (SUCR) meal. C-peptide, insulin, glucose, gastrointestinal peptides and satiety were measured up to 6 h. RESULTS: As expected, SUCR meal induced higher C-peptide (45 %), insulin (45 %) and glucose (49 %) responses compared with high-fat meals regardless of types of fatty acids (P < 0.001). Interestingly, incremental area under the curve (AUC(0-120min)) for glucagon-like peptide-1 was higher after SUCR meal compared with MUFA (27 %) and n-6 PUFA meals (23 %) (P = 0.01). AUC(0-120min) for glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide was higher after SFA meal compared with MUFA (23 %) and n-6 PUFA meals (20 %) (P = 0.004). Significant meal x time interaction (P = 0.007) was observed for ghrelin, but not cholecystokinin and satiety.

Antioxidant system response is modified by dietary fat in adipose tissue of metabolic syndrome patients.,Peña-Orihuela P; Camargo A; Rangel-Zuñiga OA; Perez-Martinez P; Cruz-Teno C; Delgado-Lista J; Yubero-Serrano EM; Paniagua JA; Tinahones FJ; Malagon MM; Roche HM; Perez-Jimenez F; Lopez-Miranda J,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with high oxidative stress, which is caused by an increased expression of NADPH-oxidase and a decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes in the adipose tissue. Our aim was to evaluate whether the quality and quantity of dietary fat can modify that process. A randomized, controlled trial conducted within the LIPGENE study assigned MetS patients to one of four diets for 12 wk each: (i) high-saturated fatty acid (HSFA), (ii) high-monounsaturated fatty acid (HMUFA), (iii) and (iv) two low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LFHCC n3), or placebo (LFHCC). A fat challenge reflecting the same fatty acid composition as the original diets was conducted post-intervention. The intake of an HSFA meal induced a higher postprandial increase in gp91phox and p67phox mRNA levels than after the intake of HMUFA, LFHCC and LFHCC n-3 meals (all p-values<0.05).

"Glu298Asp (rs1799983) Polymorphism Influences Postprandial Vascular Reactivity and the Insulin Response to Meals of Varying Fat Composition in Postmenopausal Women: Findings from the Randomized, Controlled Dietary Intervention and VAScular function (DIVAS",Rathnayake KM; Weech M; Lovegrove JA; Jackson KG,"BACKGROUND: Previous acute studies suggest the Glu298Asp polymorphism (rs1799983) may influence vascular reactivity in response to long-chain n-3 PUFA intake. However, the effects of this genotype on postprandial vascular function after meals rich in SFAs, n-6 PUFAs, and MUFAs are unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study determined the impact of the Glu298Asp polymorphism on changes in vascular function and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers in response to sequential meals of varying fat composition. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover, acute study, 32 postmenopausal women (mean ± SD age: 58 ± 5 y; BMI: 25.9 ± 4.1 kg/m2) consumed mixed meals (breakfast: 0 min, 50 g fat; lunch: 330 min, 30 g fat) containing SFAs, n-6 PUFAs, or MUFAs on 3 occasions. Blood samples for cardiometabolic disease risk markers and real-time measures of vascular reactivity [including flow-mediated dilatation (FMD; primary outcome)] were collected/performed before and regularly for 480 min after breakfast. Participants were retrospectively genotyped for the Glu298Asp (rs1799983) polymorphism. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: For the postprandial %FMD response, a test fat × genotype interaction was observed for the AUC (P = 0.019) but not incremental AUC (IAUC), with the AUC being ∼24% greater after MUFA- than after SFA- and n-6 PUFA-rich meals in the Glu298 homozygotes (P ≤ 0.026). Test fat × genotype interactions were also evident for postprandial insulin (P ≤ 0.005), with the MUFA-rich meals demonstrating significantly higher AUC (12.8%/14.9%), IAUC (14.6%/20.0%), and maximum concentration (20.0%/34.5%) than the SFA- and n-6 PUFA-rich meals, respectively, in Asp298 carriers (P < 0.05). Genotype did not influence other study outcome measures in response to the test fats. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the Glu298Asp polymorphism may represent a potential determinant of the inter-individual variability in postprandial responsiveness of %FMD and insulin to acute meal fat composition in postmenopausal women.

"Effect of a Mediterranean meal on postprandial carotenoids, paraoxonase activity and C-reactive protein levels.",Blum S; Aviram M; Ben-Amotz A; Levy Y,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Atherosclerosis involves oxidative and inflammatory mediators regulated by fat and antioxidants. Therefore, we studied the postprandial evolution of plasma lipids, carotenoids, C-reactive protein (CRP), and human serum paraoxanase activity (PON1) following two different fatty meals. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eight healthy males consumed a 45% fat 1,000 Kcal Mediterranean-like (Med) meal (monounsaturated 61% of fat) compared to a Western-like (Wes) (saturated 57% of fat) meal. Blood was collected at baseline (time 0) 2, 4 and 7 h postprandial. Plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, total carotenoids, CRP, and PON1 were analyzed. RESULTS: There was a marginal increase in cholesterol and glucose after both meals. Triglycerides increased modestly (to less than 200 mg/dl) and insulin increased (more in the Wes-like meal) but still within normal range, indicating a low glycemic index for both meals. Only the Med-like meal resulted in a significant increase in both PON1 activity (16%, p < 0.02) and carotenoids (74%, p < 0.02) with a 2-hour postprandial decrease in CRP (6%, p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: A postprandial monounsaturated fatty acid rich meal increases both plasma carotenoids and PON1 with a decrease in CRP levels, thus providing a novel potential explanation to the protective properties of a Mediterranean diet against atherogenesis.",2006,,Ann Nutr Metab,50,1,20-4,,10.1159/000089560,16276071,#6737,Blum 2006,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of sex and ethnicity on responses to a low-fat diet: a study of African Americans and whites.,Howard BV; Hannah JS; Heiser CC; Jablonski KA,"The effects of sex and ethnicity on plasma lipoprotein changes that occur with low-fat diets were studied in 34 African American subjects (20 women, 14 men) and 29 white subjects (13 women, 16 men) aged 25-62 y with moderate hypercholesterolemia. A baseline diet containing 37% fat (15% saturated) was compared with four experimental diets containing 30% fat (10% saturated) with reciprocally varying contents of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Diets were fed for 6 wk each, and all food and beverages provided and compliance were intensively monitored. Body weight and physical activity were held constant. Lowering of total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were similar between women and men and between African Americans and whites. Small differences were observed between women and men in the extent of high-density lipoprotein lowering and triacylglycerol elevations. Additionally, African American subjects had slightly higher triacylglycerol elevations than did white subjects. Results suggest that men and women of varied ethnic backgrounds should respond similarly to cholesterol-lowering diets.

The type and quantity of dietary fat and carbohydrate alter faecal microbiome and short-chain fatty acid excretion in a metabolic syndrome 'at-risk' population.,Fava F; Gitau R; Griffin BA; Gibson GR; Tuohy KM; Lovegrove JA,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: An obese-type human microbiota with an increased Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio has been described that may link the gut microbiome with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) development. Dietary fat and carbohydrate are modifiable risk factors that may impact on MetS by altering the human microbiome composition. We determined the effect of the amount and type of dietary fat and carbohydrate on faecal bacteria and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in people 'at risk' of MetS. DESIGN: A total of 88 subjects at increased MetS risk were fed a high saturated fat diet (HS) for 4 weeks (baseline), then randomised onto one of the five experimental diets for 24 weeks: HS; high monounsaturated fat (MUFA)/high glycemic index (GI) (HM/HGI); high MUFA/low GI (HM/LGI); high carbohydrate (CHO)/high GI (HC/HGI); and high CHO/low GI (HC/LGI). Dietary intakes, MetS biomarkers, faecal bacteriology and SCFA concentrations were monitored. RESULTS: High MUFA diets did not affect individual bacterial population numbers but reduced total bacteria and plasma total and LDL-cholesterol. The low fat, HC diets increased faecal Bifidobacterium (P=0.005, for HC/HGI; P=0.052, for HC/LGI) and reduced fasting glucose and cholesterol compared to baseline. HC/HGI also increased faecal Bacteroides (P=0.038), whereas HC/LGI and HS increased Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P=0.022 for HC/HGI and P=0.018, for HS). Importantly, changes in faecal Bacteroides numbers correlated inversely with body weight (r=-0.64). A total bacteria reduction was observed for high fat diets HM/HGI and HM/LGI (P=0.023 and P=0.005, respectively) and HS increased faecal SCFA concentrations (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: This study provides new evidence from a large-scale dietary intervention study that HC diets, irrespective of GI, can modulate human faecal saccharolytic bacteria, including bacteroides and bifidobacteria. Conversely, high fat diets reduced bacterial numbers, and in the HS diet, increased excretion of SCFA, which may suggest a compensatory mechanism to eliminate excess dietary energy.",2013,Feb,Int J Obes (Lond),37,2,216-23,,10.1038/ijo.2012.33,22410962,#6750,Fava 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Association between 19 dietary fatty acids intake and rheumatoid arthritis: Results of a nationwide survey.,Xie R; Zhang Y,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between dietary fatty acid intakes and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear and the available studies have focused on only a few fatty acids. This study investigated the association between the intake of 19 dietary fatty acids and RA in U.S. adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study using nationally representative data from the 2010-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariate linear regression model, multivariate logic regression models, smoothing curve fitting, and two-segment linear regression model were used to explore the relationships between 19 dietary fatty acids intakes with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) and RA risk. RESULTS: A total of 16,530 participants were included (1053 participants with RA). Intake of hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid were significantly associated with higher Hs-CRP levels, intake of hexadecenoic acid was significantly associated with higher RA risk, and intake of docosahexaenoic acid was significantly associated with lower RA risk. In addition, there was an inverted U-shaped relationship between total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) intake and RA risk, with the inflection point reached at 15.77% . CONCLUSIONS: Among the 19 dietary fatty acids, only 4 subclasses were significantly associated with Hs-CRP or RA risk.

"Effects of a low-fat diet compared with those of a high-monounsaturated fat diet on body weight, plasma lipids and lipoproteins, and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.",Gerhard GT; Ahmann A; Meeuws K; McMurry MP; Duell PB; Connor WE,"BACKGROUND: An important therapeutic goal for patients with type 2 diabetes is weight loss, which improves metabolic abnormalities. Ad libitum low-fat diets cause weight loss in nondiabetic populations. Compared with diets higher in monounsaturated fat, however, eucaloric low-fat diets may increase plasma triacylglycerol concentrations and worsen glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether, in type 2 diabetes patients, an ad libitum low-fat diet would cause greater weight loss than would a high-monounsaturated fat diet and would do this without increasing plasma triacylglycerol concentrations or worsening glycemic control. DESIGN: Eleven patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive an ad libitum low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet or a high-monounsaturated fat diet, each for 6 wk. The diets offered contained 125% of the estimated energy requirement to allow self-selection of food quantity. The response variables were body weight; fasting plasma lipid, lipoprotein, glucose, glycated hemoglobin A(1c), and fructosamine concentrations; insulin sensitivity; and glucose disposal. RESULTS: Body weight decreased significantly (1.53 kg; P < 0.001) only with the low-fat diet. Plasma total, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations tended to decrease during both diets. There were no interaction effects between diet and the lipid profile response over time. Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity did not differ significantly between the 2 diets. CONCLUSION: Contrary to expectations, the ad libitum, low-fat, high-fiber diet promoted weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes without causing unfavorable alterations in plasma lipids or glycemic control.",2004,Sep,Am J Clin Nutr,80,3,668-73,,10.1093/ajcn/80.3.668,15321807,#6763,Gerhard 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary Fats in Relation to Total and Cause-Specific Mortality in a Prospective Cohort of 521 120 Individuals With 16 Years of Follow-Up.,Zhuang P; Zhang Y; He W; Chen X; Chen J; He L; Mao L; Wu F; Jiao J,"RATIONALE: Evidence linking saturated fat intake with cardiovascular health is controversial. The associations of unsaturated fats with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality remain inconsistent, and data about non-CVD mortality are limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess dietary fat intake in relation to total and cause-specific mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data of 521 120 participants aged 50 to 71 years from the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study with 16 years of follow-up. Intakes of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans-fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were assessed via food frequency questionnaires. Hazard ratios and 95%CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Overall, 129 328 deaths were documented during 7.3 million person-years of follow-up. In the replacement of carbohydrates, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of total mortality comparing extreme quintiles were 1.29 (95% CI, 1.25-1.33) for SFAs, 1.03 (1.00-1.05) for trans-fatty acids, 0.98 (0.94-1.02) for MUFAs, 1.09 (1.06-1.13) for animal MUFAs, 0.94 (0.91-0.97) for plant MUFAs, 0.93 (0.91-0.95) for PUFAs, 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for marine omega-3 PUFAs, 1.06 (1.03-1.09) for α-linolenic acid, 0.88 (0.86-0.91) for linoleic acid, and 1.10 (1.08-1.13) for arachidonic acid. CVD mortality was inversely associated with marine omega-3 PUFA intake ( P trend <0.0001), whereas it was positively associated with SFA, trans-fatty acid, and arachidonic acid intake. Isocalorically replacing 5% of the energy from SFAs with plant MUFAs was associated with 15%, 10%, 11%, and 30% lower total mortality, CVD, cancer, and respiratory disease mortality, respectively. Isocaloric replacement of SFA with linoleic acid (2%) was associated with lower total (8%), CVD (6%), cancer (8%), respiratory disease (11%), and diabetes mellitus (9%) mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Intakes of SFAs, trans-fatty acids, animal MUFAs, α-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid were associated with higher mortality. Dietary intake of marine omega-3 PUFAs and replacing SFAs with plant MUFAs or linoleic acid were associated with lower total, CVD, and certain cause-specific mortality.

The effect of apoE genotype and sex on ApoE plasma concentration is determined by dietary fat in healthy subjects.,Moreno JA; Pérez-Jiménez F; Moreno-Luna R; Pérez-Martínez P; Fuentes-Jiménez F; Marín C; Portugal H; Lairon D; López-Miranda J,"The interindividual variation in ApoE plasma concentration is considerable, mainly determined by apoE genotype and sex. However, a large amount of variability remains unexplained by these factors. We have evaluated whether the quantity and quality of dietary fat interacts with the apoE genotype and sex modifying ApoE plasma levels in young healthy subjects. Eighty-four volunteers (sixty-six apoE3/3, eight apoE4/3 and ten apoE3/2) were subjected to three dietary periods, each lasting 4 weeks. The first was a SFA-enriched diet (38 % fat and 20 % SFA), which was followed by a carbohydrate (CHO)-rich diet (30 % fat, < 10 % SFA and 55 % carbohydrate) or a MUFA-rich diet (38 % fat and 22 % MUFA) following a randomised crossover design. apoE2 carriers have the highest ApoE levels, whereas apoE4 individuals show the lowest concentration after the SFA, CHO and MUFA diets. Women had significantly higher ApoE concentration than men only after the consumption of the SFA diet. The SFA diet increased the ApoE plasma concentration when compared with the CHO- and MUFA-rich diets in women, but not in men. In women, but not in men, the shift from the SFA- to CHO- or MUFA-rich diets significantly decreased the ApoE concentration in apoE3/2 and apoE3/3 subjects, whereas no differences were observed in women with the apoE4/3 genotype. Sex and apoE genotype determine ApoE plasma levels; however, this effect is dependent on dietary fat.",2009,Jun,Br J Nutr,101,12,1745-52,,10.1017/S0007114508111515,19025720,#6781,Moreno 2009,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease in men: the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.,Virtanen JK; Mursu J; Tuomainen TP; Voutilainen S,"OBJECTIVE: The epidemiological evidence of the role of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) is inconsistent. We investigated the associations of dietary fatty acids with the risk of CHD and carotid atherosclerosis in men with high SFA intake and high rates of CHD. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In total, 1981 men from the population-based Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD), aged 42 to 60 years and free of CHD at baseline in 1984 to 1989, were investigated. Food consumption was assessed with 4-day food recording. Multivariate nutrient-density models were used to analyze isocaloric replacement of nutrients. CHD events were ascertained from national registries. Carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by ultrasonography of the common carotid artery intima-media thickness in 1015 men. During the average follow-up of 21.4 years, 183 fatal and 382 nonfatal CHD events occurred. SFA or trans fat intakes were not associated with CHD risk. In contrast, monounsaturated fat intake was associated with increased risk and polyunsaturated fat intake with decreased risk of fatal CHD, whether replacing SFA, trans fat, or carbohydrates. The associations with carotid atherosclerosis were broadly similar, whereas the associations with nonfatal CHD were weaker. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SFA intake is not an independent risk factor for CHD, even in a population with higher ranges of SFA intake. In contrast, polyunsaturated fat intake was associated with lower risk of fatal CHD, whether replacing SFA, trans fat, or carbohydrates.

Effects of exchanging carbohydrate or monounsaturated fat with saturated fat on inflammatory and thrombogenic responses in subjects with abdominal obesity: A randomized controlled trial.,Teng KT; Chang LF; Vethakkan SR; Nesaretnam K; Sanders TAB,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Modification of the amount and type of dietary fat has diverse effects on cardiovascular risk. METHODS: We recruited 54 abdominally obese subjects to participate in a prospective cross-over design, single-blind trial comparing isocaloric 2000 kcal MUFA or carbohydrate-enriched diet with SFA-enriched diet (control). The control diet consisted of 15E% protein, 53E% carbohydrate and 32E% fat (12E% SFA, 13E% MUFA). A total of ∼7E% of MUFA or refined carbohydrate was exchanged with SFA in the MUFA-rich and carbohydrate-rich diets respectively for 6-weeks. Blood samples were collected at fasting upon trial commencement and at week-5 and 6 of each dietary-intervention phase to measure levels of cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β), C-reactive protein (CRP), thrombogenic markers (E-selectin, PAI-1, D-dimer) and lipid subfractions. Radial pulse wave analysis and a 6-h postprandial mixed meal challenge were carried out at week-6 of each dietary intervention. Blood samples were collected at fasting, 15 and 30 min and hourly intervals thereafter till 6 h after a mixed meal challenge (muffin and milkshake) with SFA or MUFA (872.5 kcal, 50 g fat, 88 g carbohydrates) or CARB (881.3 kcal, 20 g fat, 158 g carbohydrates)- enrichment corresponding to the background diets. RESULTS: No significant differences in fasting inflammatory and thrombogenic factors were noted between diets (P > 0.05). CARB meal was found to increase plasma IL-6 whereas MUFA meal elevated plasma D-dimer postprandially compared with SAFA meal (P < 0.05). Comparing the 3 meals, there were similar postprandial elevations in IL-6 and D-dimer and postprandial reductions in PAI-1, augmentation index and pressure (time effect: P < 0.05). CARB diet was found to reduce HDL(3) by 7.8% and increase small dense HDL (sdHDL) by 8.6% compared with SFA diet (P < 0.05). SFA diet increased large HDL subfractions compared with both CARB and MUFA diets by 4.9% and 6.6% (P < 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence presented in this study suggests that the replacement of SFA with MUFA or refined carbohydrates may not improve inflammatory and thrombogenic markers in abdominally overweight individuals.

Effect of 360His mutation in apolipoprotein A-IV on plasma HDL-cholesterol response to dietary fat.,Jansen S; Lopez-Miranda J; Ordovas JM; Zambrana JL; Marin C; Ostos MA; Castro P; McPherson R; Lopez Segura F; Blanco A; Jimenez Pereperez JA; Perez-Jimenez F,"In order to determine whether genetic variability of apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV is responsible for the improvement in lipid profile when dietary saturated fats are replaced by carbohydrates or monounsaturated fats, 41 healthy male subjects were studied: 33 were homozygous for the 360Gln allele and 8 were heterozygote carriers of the 360His allele. These were administered three consecutive 4-week diets. The first was a diet rich in saturated fat (SAT diet, with 38% fat, 20% saturated. This was followed by a low fat diet (NCEP-I, with < 30% fat, < 10% saturated). The final diet was rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA diet, with 38% fat, 22% monounsaturated). There was no difference in plasma lipid and apolipoprotein levels of both groups of individuals after consuming the SAT diet. Switching from this diet to the NCEP-I diet, carriers of the 360His allele presented a greater decrease in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (-10 vs. -1 mg/dL, P < 0.004) and apoA-I levels (-19 vs. -8 mg/dL, P < 0.037). Similarly, replacement of carbohydrates by monounsaturated fats produced a greater increase in HDL-C (9 vs. 1 mg/dL, P < 0.003) and apoA-I levels (9 vs. 2 mg/dL, P < 0.036) in carriers of the 360His mutation. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activities and apoA-IV levels were also measured.

One-year comparison of a high-monounsaturated fat diet with a high-carbohydrate diet in type 2 diabetes.,Brehm BJ; Lattin BL; Summer SS; Boback JA; Gilchrist GM; Jandacek RJ; D'Alessio DA,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of high-monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and high-carbohydrate (CHO) diets on body weight and glycemic control in men and women with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight/obese participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 124, age = 56.5 +/- 0.8 years, BMI = 35.9 +/- 0.3 kg/m2, and A1C = 7.3 +/- 0.1%) were randomly assigned to 1 year of a high-MUFA or high-CHO diet. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 months of dieting. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. The overall retention rate for 1 year was 77% (69% for the high-MUFA group and 84% for the high-CHO group; P = 0.06). Based on food records, both groups had similar energy intake but a significant difference in MUFA intake. Both groups had similar weight loss over 1 year (-4.0 +/- 0.8 vs. -3.8 +/- 0.6 kg) and comparable improvement in body fat, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, A1C, and fasting glucose and insulin.

Substituting dietary saturated for monounsaturated fat impairs insulin sensitivity in healthy men and women: The KANWU Study.,Vessby B; Uusitupa M; Hermansen K; Riccardi G; Rivellese AA; Tapsell LC; Nälsén C; Berglund L; Louheranta A; Rasmussen BM; Calvert GD; Maffetone A; Pedersen E; Gustafsson IB; Storlien LH,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The amount and quality of fat in the diet could be of importance for development of insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders. Our aim was to determine whether a change in dietary fat quality alone could alter insulin action in humans. METHODS: The KANWU study included 162 healthy subjects chosen at random to receive a controlled, isoenergetic diet for 3 months containing either a high proportion of saturated (SAFA diet) or monounsaturated (MUFA diet) fatty acids. Within each group there was a second assignment at random to supplements with fish oil (3.6 g n-3 fatty acids/d) or placebo. RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity was significantly impaired on the saturated fatty acid diet (-10%, p = 0.03) but did not change on the monounsaturated fatty acid diet (+2%, NS) (p = 0.05 for difference between diets). Insulin secretion was not affected. The addition of n-3 fatty acids influenced neither insulin sensitivity nor insulin secretion. The favourable effects of substituting a monounsaturated fatty acid diet for a saturated fatty acid diet on insulin sensitivity were only seen at a total fat intake below median (37E%). Here, insulin sensitivity was 12.5% lower and 8.8% higher on the saturated fatty acid diet and monounsaturated fatty acid diet respectively (p = 0.03). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) increased on the saturated fatty acid diet (+4.1%, p < 0.01) but decreased on the monounsaturated fatty acid diet (MUFA) (-5.2, p < 0.001), whereas lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] increased on a monounsaturated fatty acid diet by 12% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A change of the proportions of dietary fatty acids, decreasing saturated fatty acid and increasing monounsaturated fatty acid, improves insulin sensitivity but has no effect on insulin secretion.

Controlled feeding studies and measures of short-term resting energy expenditure (REE) have suggested that the type of dietary fat may alter energy expenditure (EE). OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effects of an HF diet rich in either monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids (FAs) and of exercise on EE and chronic disease risk factors. DESIGN: Eight healthy men [age: 18-45 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 22 +/- 3] were randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 crossover design to 1 of 4 treatments: HF diet (50% of energy) with a high amount of saturated fat (22% of energy) plus exercise (SE) or a sedentary (SS) condition or a diet high in monounsaturated fat (30% of energy) plus exercise (UE) or a sedentary (US) condition. The subjects spent 5 d in a metabolic chamber and cycled at 45% of maximal oxygen uptake for 2 h each day during the exercise visits. Respiratory gases and urinary nitrogen were measured to determine 24-h EE. Resting metabolic rate was measured on days 2, 4, and 6. RESULTS: Average 24-h EE was not different with respect to dietary FA composition (3202 +/- 146, 3208 +/- 151, 2240 +/- 82, and 2270 +/- 104 for SE, UE, SS, and US, respectively). Total and LDL cholesterol and blood pressure were significantly greater after the SE and SS treatments than after the UE and US treatments. CONCLUSION: Resting metabolic rate and 24-h EE were not significantly different after short-term exposure to an HF diet rich in monounsaturated FAs or after exposure to a diet rich in saturated FAs in healthy, nonobese men.",2009,May,Am J Clin Nutr,89,5,1350-6,,10.3945/ajcn.2008.27419,19321562,#6825,Cooper 2009,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Dietary fat saturation, but not the feeding state, modulates rates of cholesterol esterification in normolipidemic men.",Mazier MJ; Jones PJ,"To determine whether the rates of cholesterol esterification in normal individuals are affected by diets differing in fats, nine men were randomly assigned to three groups receiving a diet rich in monounsaturated (MONO), polyunsaturated (POLY), or saturated (SAT) fat for 2 weeks using a crossover design. Subjects drank a dose of deuterium oxide, and the fractional esterification rate (FER) was calculated during fed and unfed periods. Total esterified cholesterol was calculated as the product of the FER and pool size, the latter obtained from a decay curve following injection of [4-14C]-cholesterol. The POLY diet produced the lowest serum cholesterol concentration and the SAT diet the highest (P < .001). For cholesterol ester (CE) deuterium enrichment, an interaction was noted between diet and time (P < .01). The FER was greater (P < .003) in subjects fed the POLY diet versus either of the other diets, although the amount of esterified cholesterol produced, expressed as either milligrams per day (P < .103) or milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (P < .100), did not differ among groups. No effect of the feeding state was found for either the FER (P < .187) or total esterified cholesterol expressed as milligrams per day (P < .146) or milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (P < .128). The results suggest that the diet fat type, but not the feeding state, may be responsible for serum esterified cholesterol concentrations.",1999,Oct,Metabolism,48,10,1210-5,,10.1016/s0026-0495(99)90257-3,10535380,#6835,Mazier 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of Dietary Intake of Saturated Fatty Acids on the Development of Atrial Fibrillation and the Effect of Replacement of Saturated With Monounsaturated and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids.,Dinesen PT; Joensen AM; Rix TA; Tjønneland A; Schmidt EB; Lundbye-Christensen S; Overvad K,"The aim of the present study was to explore substitution of intake of saturated fatty acids (FAs) with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FAs and incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in men and women. A total of 57,053 Danish participants aged 50 to 64 years were enrolled in the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study in 1993 to 1997 and completed a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Follow-up was registry-based and data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The statistical model was formulated in such a way that 1 g/day of saturated FAs was replaced with 1 g/day of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated FAs while keeping total fat intake, total energy intake, and energy intake from protein and carbohydrates constant. During a median follow-up of 17 years, 5,175 incident cases of AF occurred. In men, there was a higher hazard of AF when total n-3 polyunsaturated FAs replaced dietary saturated FAs-hazard ratio per 1-g substitution of FAs of 1.08 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.14) in a model adjusted for lifestyle factors. For other substitutions of FAs (monounsaturated, total or n-6 polyunsaturated FAs), no consistent nor statistically significant associations were found. In conclusion, we found a moderately higher risk of AF in men, but not in women, when total n-3 polyunsaturated FAs replaced dietary saturated FAs. Substitution of saturated FAs with monounsaturated, total or n-6 polyunsaturated FAs was not associated with the risk of AF.",2017,Oct,Am J Cardiol,120,7,1129-1132,,10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.06.053,28803653,#6837,Dinesen 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Altering source or amount of dietary carbohydrate has acute and chronic effects on postprandial glucose and triglycerides in type 2 diabetes: Canadian trial of Carbohydrates in Diabetes (CCD).,Wolever TM; Gibbs AL; Chiasson JL; Connelly PW; Josse RG; Leiter LA; Maheux P; Rabasa-Lhoret R; Rodger NW; Ryan EA,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nutrition recommendations for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are partly guided by the postprandial responses elicited by diets varying in carbohydrate (CHO). We aimed to explore whether long-term changes in postprandial responses on low-glycemic-index (GI) or low-CHO diets were due to acute or chronic effects in T2DM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects with diet-alone-treated T2DM were randomly assigned to high-CHO/high-GI (H), high-CHO/low-GI (L), or low-CHO/high-monounsaturated-fat (M) diets for 12-months. At week-0 (Baseline) postprandial responses after H-meals (55% CHO, GI = 61) were measured from 0800 h to 1600 h. After 12 mo subjects were randomly assigned to H-meals or study diet meals (L, 57% CHO, GI = 50; M, 44% CHO, GI = 61). This yielded 5 groups: H diet with H-meals (HH, n = 34); L diet with H- (LH, n = 17) or L-meals (LL, n = 16); and M diet with H- (MH, n = 18) or M meals (MM, n = 19). Postprandial glucose fluctuations were lower in LL than all other groups (p < 0.001). Changes in postprandial-triglycerides differed among groups (p < 0.001). After 12 mo in HH and MM both fasting- and postprandial-triglycerides were similar to Baseline while in MH postprandial-triglycerides were significantly higher than at Baseline (p = 0.028). In LH, triglycerides were consistently (0.18-0.34 mmol/L) higher than Baseline throughout the day, while in LL the difference from Baseline varied across the day from 0.04 to 0.36 mmol/L (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Low-GI and low-CHO diets have both acute and chronic effects on postprandial glucose and triglycerides in T2DM subjects. Thus, the composition of the acute test-meal and the habitual diet should be considered when interpreting the nutritional implications of different postprandial responses.",2013,Mar,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,23,3,227-34,ISRCTN/ISRCTN81151522,10.1016/j.numecd.2011.12.011,22397878,#6840,Wolever 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The effects of monounsaturated-fat enriched diet and polyunsaturated-fat enriched diet on lipid and glucose metabolism in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.,Sarkkinen E; Schwab U; Niskanen L; Hannuksela M; Savolainen M; Kervinen K; Kesäniemi A; Uusitupa MI,"OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTS: The effects of a high-fat, monounsaturated-fat enriched (Mono) diet and a reduced-fat, polyunsaturated-fat enriched (Poly) diet on lipid and glucose metabolism were compared in 31 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: After 3 weeks on a Run-in diet (37; 18:11:5, indicating energy percentages from total fat; saturated:monounsaturated:polyunsaturated fatty acids in the actual diets) subjects were randomized into a Poly-diet (34; 11:10:10) or a Mono-diet (40; 11:19:8) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: In the Mono group fasting plasma glucose (mean +/- SD) was lower after the test diet than after the run-in period (6.4 +/- 1.3 vs 6.0 +/- 0.8 mmol/L, 0 vs 8 weeks, P = 0.008), but remained unchanged in the Poly group (6.2 +/- 0.6 vs 6.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/L). Glucose effectiveness (SG), insulin sensitivity index and the first phase insulin response in an intravenous glucose tolerance test did not change significantly during either of the diets, but at the end of the study SG was higher in the Mono group than in the Poly group (P = 0.013). Serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B decreased in the Mono group, while in the Poly group only serum total cholesterol decreased significantly. However, the mean changes in serum lipids and lipoproteins did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In free-living subjects with impaired glucose tolerance both the Mono-diet and the Poly-diet consumed after a saturated-fat enriched Run-in diet improved serum lipid profile and the Mono-diet seemed to improve glucose metabolism as well.",1996,Sep,Eur J Clin Nutr,50,9,592-8,,,8880038,#6845,Sarkkinen 1996,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of stearic acid and trans fatty acids versus linoleic acid on blood pressure in normotensive women and men.,Zock PL; Blijlevens RA; de Vries JH; Katan MB,"The objective of this study was to compare the effect of linoleic acid (cis,cis-C18:2) with that of its hydrogenation products stearic acid (C18:0) and elaidic acid (trans-C18:1) on blood pressure levels in normotensive humans. We therefore measured the effects of these fatty acids on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 30 women and 25 men. Three strictly controlled experimental diets were supplied to every subject for 3 weeks each, in different order (multiple cross-over). The composition of the three diets was constant, except for 8% of daily energy, which was provided by either linoleic acid, stearic acid, or monounsaturated trans fatty acids. The statistical power for detecting a true difference between two diets of 3 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was over 90%. Mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure at the end of the dietary periods was 114/69 mmHg on the linoleic acid diet, 113/70 on the stearic acid diet, and 113/69 on the trans fatty acid diet. No significant differences were observed in blood pressure levels after 3 weeks on each diet. We conclude that a major increase in the intake of linoleic acid at the expense of stearic acid or trans fatty acids has no effect on blood pressure in normotensive young women and men.",1993,Jun,Eur J Clin Nutr,47,6,437-44,,,8365385,#6851,Zock 1993,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Nutritional status in relation to adipokines and oxidative stress is associated with disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,Hayashi H; Satoi K; Sato-Mito N; Kaburagi T; Yoshino H; Higaki M; Nishimoto K; Sato K,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether disease activity was associated with dietary habits, nutritional status, adipokines, and oxidative stress in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: The subjects were 37 patients with RA. The assessment of the nutritional status included anthropometric and biochemical parameters. A food-frequency questionnaire and a 3-d diet record to assess dietary intake were used. The serum levels of adipokines and oxidative stress markers in sera and saliva were measured. The disease activity was determined using the 28 Disease Activity Score (DAS28). We divided the subjects into high (DAS28 ≥3.2) and low (DAS28 <3.2) disease activity groups. RESULTS: The serum leptin and albumin levels were significantly lower, whereas the inflammatory markers were increased, in the high disease activity group. The dietary intake assessment showed a lower intake of fish oil and a lower ratio of monounsaturated fatty acid intake in the high disease activity group. There was a negative correlation between the DAS28 and the dietary intake of the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acid to total fatty acid intake. The serum oxidative stress marker (reactive oxygen metabolites) showed a positive correlation to the DAS28. The salivary reactive oxygen metabolites also correlated with C-reactive protein and serum reactive oxygen metabolites. CONCLUSION: Altered serum adipokine levels with decreased albumin may reflect the deterioration that is associated with rheumatoid arthritis. An increased oxidative stress was observed in sera and saliva. Intakes of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, fish oil, and monounsaturated fatty acid seem to affect disease activity and may have beneficial effects by decreasing inflammation.",2012,Nov-Dec,Nutrition,28,12-Nov,1109-14,,10.1016/j.nut.2012.02.009,23044162,#6863,Hayashi 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Adding monounsaturated fatty acids to a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods in hypercholesterolemia.,Jenkins DJ; Chiavaroli L; Wong JM; Kendall C; Lewis GF; Vidgen E; Connelly PW; Leiter LA; Josse RG; Lamarche B,"BACKGROUND: Higher intake of monounsaturated fat may raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol without raising low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. We tested whether increasing the monounsaturated fat content of a diet proven effective for lowering LDL cholesterol (dietary portfolio) also modified other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, specifically by increasing HDL cholesterol, lowering serum triglyceride and further reducing the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with hyperlipidemia consumed a therapeutic diet very low in saturated fat for one month and were then randomly assigned to a dietary portfolio low or high in monounsaturated fatty acid for another month. We supplied participants' food for the two-month period. Calorie intake was based on Harris-Benedict estimates for energy requirements. RESULTS: For patients who consumed the dietary portfolio high in monounsaturated fat, HDL cholesterol rose, whereas for those consuming the dietary portfolio low in monounsaturated fat, HDL cholesterol did not change. The 12.5% treatment difference was significant (0.12 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05 to 0.21, p = 0.003). The ratio of total to HDL cholesterol was reduced by 6.5% with the diet high in monounsaturated fat relative to the diet low in monounsaturated fat (-0.28, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.04, p = 0.025). Patients consuming the diet high in monounsaturated fat also had significantly higher concentrations of apolipoprotein AI, and their C-reactive protein was significantly lower. No treatment differences were seen for triglycerides, other lipids or body weight, and mean weight loss was similar for the diets high in monounsaturated fat (-0.8 kg) and low in monounsaturated fat (-1.2 kg). INTERPRETATION: Monounsaturated fat increased the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering dietary portfolio, despite statin-like reductions in LDL cholesterol. The potential benefits for cardiovascular risk were achieved through increases in HDL cholesterol, further reductions in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and reductions in C-reactive protein.

Dietary Fatty Acid Intake and the Colonic Gut Microbiota in Humans.,Xu AA; Kennedy LK; Hoffman K; White DL; Kanwal F; El-Serag HB; Petrosino JF; Jiao L,"A high-fat diet has been associated with systemic diseases in humans and alterations in gut microbiota in animal studies. However, the influence of dietary fatty acid intake on gut microbiota in humans has not been well studied. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the association between intake of total fatty acids (TFAs), saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TrFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n3-FAs, and n6-FAs, and the community composition and structure of the adherent colonic gut microbiota. We obtained 97 colonic biopsies from 34 participants with endoscopically normal colons. Microbial DNA was used to sequence the 16S rRNA V4 region. The DADA2 and SILVA database were used for amplicon sequence variant assignment. Dietary data were collected using the Block food frequency questionnaire. The biodiversity and the relative abundance of the bacterial taxa by higher vs. lower fat intake were compared using the Mann−Whitney test followed by multivariable negative binomial regression model. False discovery rate−adjusted p-values (q value) < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. The beta diversity of gut bacteria differed significantly by intake of all types of fatty acids. The relative abundance of Sutterella was significantly higher with higher intake of TFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, and n6-FAs. The relative abundance of Tyzzerella and Fusobacterium was significantly higher with higher intake of SFAs. Tyzzerella was also higher with higher intake of TrFA. These observations were confirmed by multivariate analyses. Dietary fat intake was associated with bacterial composition and structure. Sutterella, Fusobacterium, and Tyzzerella were associated with fatty acid intake.",2022,Jun,Nutrients,14,13,,,10.3390/nu14132722,35807903,#6891,Xu 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of dietary trans fatty acids on blood pressure in normotensive subjects.,Mensink RP; de Louw MH; Katan MB,"Consumption of essential fatty acids of the (n-6) series may affect blood pressure in man.

Diet (food records) and circulating metabolites were studied at six time points between the ages of 9-19 years (n = 549-338). Dietary targets for this study were defined as (1) the ratio of saturated fat (SAFA) to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA + PUFA) < 1:2, (2) intake of SAFA < 10% of total energy intake, (3) fiber intake ≥ 80th age-specific percentile, and (4) sucrose intake ≤ 20th age-specific percentile. Metabolic biomarkers were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics. Better adherence to the dietary targets, regardless of study group allocation, was assoiated with higher serum proportion of PUFAs, lower serum proportion of SAFAs, and a higher degree of unsaturation of fatty acids. Achieving ≥ 1 dietary target resulted in higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size, lower circulating LDL subclass lipid concentrations, and lower circulating lipid concentrations in medium and small high-density lipoprotein subclasses compared to meeting 0 targets. Attaining more dietary targets (≥2) was associated with a tendency to lower lipid concentrations of intermediate-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein subclasses.

Dietary Patterns during Pregnancy Are Associated with Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,Shin D; Lee KW; Song WO,"Maternal dietary patterns before and during pregnancy play important roles in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We aimed to identify dietary patterns during pregnancy that are associated with GDM risk in pregnant U.S. women. From a 24 h dietary recall of 253 pregnant women (16-41 years) included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2012, food items were aggregated into 28 food groups based on Food Patterns Equivalents Database. Three dietary patterns were identified by reduced rank regression with responses including prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), dietary fiber, and ratio of poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acid: ""high refined grains, fats, oils and fruit juice"", ""high nuts, seeds, fat and soybean; low milk and cheese"", and ""high added sugar and organ meats; low fruits, vegetables and seafood"". GDM was diagnosed using fasting plasma glucose levels ≥5.1 mmol/L for gestation <24 weeks. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for GDM, after controlling for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, family poverty income ratio, marital status, prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, energy intake, physical activity, and log-transformed C-reactive protein (CRP). All statistical analyses accounted for the appropriate survey design and sample weights of the NHANES. Of 249 pregnant women, 34 pregnant women (14%) had GDM. Multivariable AOR (95% CIs) of GDM for comparisons between the highest vs. lowest tertiles were 4.9 (1.4-17.0) for ""high refined grains, fats, oils and fruit juice"" pattern, 7.5 (1.8-32.3) for ""high nuts, seeds, fat and soybean; low milk and cheese"" pattern, and 22.3 (3.9-127.4) for ""high added sugar and organ meats; low fruits, vegetables and seafood"" pattern after controlling for maternal sociodemographic variables, prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, energy intake and log-transformed CRP. These findings suggest that dietary patterns during pregnancy are associated with risk of GDM after controlling for potential confounders. The observed connection between a high consumption of refined grains, fat, added sugars and low intake of fruits and vegetables during pregnancy with higher odds for GDM, are consistent with general health benefits of healthy diets, but warrants further research to understand underlying pathophysiology of GDM associated with dietary behaviors during pregnancy.",2015,Nov,Nutrients,7,11,9369-82,,10.3390/nu7115472,26569302,#6896,Shin 2015,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Polyunsaturated fatty acids result in greater cholesterol lowering and less triacylglycerol elevation than do monounsaturated fatty acids in a dose-response comparison in a multiracial study group.,Howard BV; Hannah JS; Heiser CC; Jablonski KA; Paidi MC; Alarif L; Robbins DC; Howard WJ,"Cholesterol-lowering effects of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were compared as they were varied in a reciprocal dose-dependent fashion in the context of a National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 1 diet. The study population comprised 63 moderately hypercholesterolemic African American and white men and women. After a 6-wk baseline diet containing 37% of energy from total fat and 15% from saturated fat, participants consumed four diets for 6 wk each, in random order, containing 10% of energy as saturated fatty acids; 3%, 6%, 10%, and 14% of energy as polyunsaturated fatty acids; and 17%, 14%, 10%, and 6% of energy as monounsaturated fatty acids. Dietary cholesterol, fiber, plant sterol, and squalene contents were constant with all four diets. There was a progressive decrease in total (P = 0.028) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.184) across the four diets, with the greatest decrease observed in the diet with the highest content of polyunsaturated fatty acids; a small but significant decrease in high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol that did not show a trend between the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated diets; and a trend between the four diets in triacylglycerol elevations (P = 0.029), with the smallest increment occurring in the diets highest in polyunsaturates. The magnitude of the cholesterol-lowering response was greater in those with higher baseline cholesterol and less in those who were more obese. The dietary response was similar in both ethnic groups and in both sexes. In conclusion, in an NCEP Step 1 diet containing 30% total fat, with all other known cholesterol-influencing dietary factors held constant, the substitution of polyunsaturated fatty acid for monounsaturated fatty acid from 3% to 14% resulted in a progressive decline in total cholesterol and less triacylglycerol elevations, without effect on HDL cholesterol.",1995,Aug,Am J Clin Nutr,62,2,392-402,,10.1093/ajcn/62.2.392,7625348,#6898,Howard 1995,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

Proteome from patients with metabolic syndrome is regulated by quantity and quality of dietary lipids.,Rangel-Zúñiga OA; Camargo A; Marin C; Peña-Orihuela P; Pérez-Martínez P; Delgado-Lista J; González-Guardia L; Yubero-Serrano EM; Tinahones FJ; Malagón MM; Pérez-Jiménez F; Roche HM; López-Miranda J,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a multi-component disorder associated to a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Its etiology is the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, including dietary habits. We aimed to identify the target proteins modulated by the long-term consumption of four diets differing in the quality and quantity of lipids in the whole proteome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: A randomized, controlled trial conducted within the LIPGENE study assigned 24 MetS patients for 12 weeks each to 1 of 4 diets: a) high-saturated fatty acid (HSFA), b) high-monounsaturated fatty acid (HMUFA), c) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets supplemented with placebo (LFHCC) and d) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets supplemented with long chain (LC) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (LFHCC n-3). We analyzed the changes induced in the proteome of both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of PBMC using 2-D proteomic analysis. Sixty-seven proteins were differentially expressed after the long-term consumption of the four diets. The HSFA diet induced the expression of proteins responding to oxidative stress, degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and DNA repair. However, HMUFA, LFHCC and LFHCC n-3 diets down-regulated pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress-related proteins and DNA repairing proteins. CONCLUSION: The long-term consumption of HSFA, compared to HMUFA, LFHCC and LFHCC n-3, seems to increase the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, such as inflammation and oxidative stress, and seem lead to DNA damage as a consequence of high oxidative stress.",2015,Jul,BMC Genomics,16,1,509,,10.1186/s12864-015-1725-8,26152126,#6907,Rangel-Zúñiga 2015,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Comparison of a high-carbohydrate diet with a high-monounsaturated-fat diet in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,Garg A; Bonanome A; Grundy SM; Zhang ZJ; Unger RH,"We compared a high-carbohydrate diet with a high-fat diet (specifically, a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids) for effects on glycemic control and plasma lipoproteins in 10 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) receiving insulin therapy. The patients were randomly assigned to receive first one diet and then the other, each for 28 days, in a metabolic ward. In the high-carbohydrate diet, 25 percent of the energy was in the form of fat and 60 percent in the form of carbohydrates (47 percent of the total energy was in the form of complex carbohydrates); the high-monounsaturated-fat diet was 50 percent fat (33 percent of the total energy in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids) and 35 percent carbohydrates. The two diets had the same amounts of simple carbohydrates and fiber. As compared with the high-carbohydrate diet, the high-monounsaturated-fat diet resulted in lower mean plasma glucose levels and reduced insulin requirements, lower levels of plasma triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (lower by 25 and 35 percent, respectively; P less than 0.01), and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (higher by 13 percent; P less than 0.005). Levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol did not differ significantly in patients on the two diets. These preliminary results suggest that partial replacement of complex carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids in the diets of patients with NIDDM does not increase the level of LDL cholesterol and may improve glycemic control and the levels of plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol.",1988,Sep,N Engl J Med,319,13,829-34,,10.1056/NEJM198809293191304,3045553,#6908,Garg 1988,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Effects of dietary fat saturation on eicosanoid production, platelet aggregation and blood pressure.",Lahoz C; Alonso R; Ordovás JM; López-Farré A; de Oya M; Mata P,"The effects of dietary fat saturation on eicosanoid urinary excretion, platelet aggregation (PA) and blood pressure (BP) were studied in 42 healthy subjects. They consumed four consecutive diets differing in their fat saturation [saturated (SFA); monounsaturated (MUFA); polyunsaturated n-6 (PUFA n-6); and polyunsaturated n-6/n-3, (PUFA n-3)]. Each diet period lasted 5 weeks. There were no differences in 24-h 2,3-dinor-6- keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha excretion among dietary periods. A significant effect was noted regarding the excretion of 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (P < 0.0001). During the PUFA n-6 phase the excretion was significantly higher than during SFA and MUFA periods. Dietary fatty acid composition had a significant effect on ADP (1 mumolL-1) and collagen (2 mgL-1) induced PA. Dietary fat also had a significant effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001). Both were significantly higher during the SFA period than during the other three periods.

Postprandial glucose and NF-κB responses are regulated differently by monounsaturated fatty acid and dietary fiber in impaired fasting glucose subjects.,Kim JY; Kwon HY; Kim KS; Kim MK; Kwon O,"Recently, much attention has been paid to observational studies that have linked postprandial glycemic response with the risk of cardiovascular disease. In this study, we investigated whether the nutrient composition of dietary formula might affect the postprandial inflammation in impaired fasting glucose (IFG) subjects. Eight subjects underwent three trials in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study with a 1-week washout period. The subjects were given three formulas according to serving size: (1) high-fiber formula (FF); (2) high-monounsaturated fatty acid formula (MF); and (3) control formula (CF). The area under the curves (AUCs) for glucose decreased 0.65- and 0.54-fold in the FF and MF trials, respectively, when compared with CF. A similar pattern was observed for the postprandial insulin response. However, as observed by the phosphorylation of proteolytic degradation product IκB, the AUC for activation of nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was significantly decreased in the FF trial, but not with MF (P=.0114).

Alternative Foods in Cardio-Healthy Dietary Models That Improve Postprandial Lipemia and Insulinemia in Obese People.,Muñoz-Perez DM; Gonzalez-Correa CH; Astudillo-Muñoz EY; Porras-Hurtado GL; Sanchez-Giraldo M; Lopez-Miranda J; Camargo A; Rangel-Zuñiga OA,"Obesity is one of the major health problems worldwide. Following healthy dietary patterns can be difficult in some countries due to the lack of availability of certain foods; thus, alternative foods are needed. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of a dietary pattern consisting of fruit, avocado, whole grains, and trout (FAWGT) on postprandial insulinemia and lipemia in obese Colombian subjects. A randomized controlled crossover study was conducted, in which 44 subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) followed either a FAWGT diet or a diet high in saturated fat and rich in processed carbohydrates. Levels of lipids and carbohydrates were measured during the postprandial state. The FAWGT diet reduced fasting insulin, VLDL, and HOMA-IR after 8 weeks (p < 0.05), while there was a lower postprandial increase in TG, VLDL, and insulin levels after both acute and chronic intake of FAWGT diet (p < 0.05). The intake of FAWGT-diet was characterized by high consumption of foods rich in fiber, MUFAs, and vitamins C and E (p < 0.05). The consumption of a diet composed of fruit, avocado, whole grains, and trout has emerged as a valid alternative to the foods included in other heart-healthy diets since it improves postprandial lipemia and insulinemia in obese people and has similar beneficial effects to these healthy models.",2021,Jun,Nutrients,13,7,,,10.3390/nu13072225,34209561,#6949,Muñoz-Perez 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Fruit and vegetable consumption is inversely associated with blood pressure in a Mediterranean population with a high vegetable-fat intake: the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Study.,Alonso A; de la Fuente C; Martín-Arnau AM; de Irala J; Martínez JA; Martínez-González MA,"There is evidence that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables reduces blood pressure (BP). Characteristically, the Mediterranean diet is rich in plant-derived foods and also in fat, but studies conducted in Mediterranean countries to relate diet to BP are scarce. We studied the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and BP in a cross-sectional analysis of 4393 participants in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Study, an ongoing dynamic cohort study in Spain. Diet was measured using a food-frequency questionnaire previously validated in Spain. Fat represented more than 37 % total energy intake. Subjects were considered to have undiagnosed hypertension if they reported systolic BP > or = 140 mmHg or diastolic BP > or = 90 mmHg, and not a medical diagnosis of hypertension. The adjusted prevalence odds ratio of undiagnosed hypertension (upper v. lowest quintile) was 0.58 (95 % CI 0.36, 0.91; P for trend 0.01) for vegetable consumption and 0.68 (95 % CI 0.43, 1.09; P for trend 0.10) for fruit consumption. Comparing those in the highest quintile of both fruit and vegetable consumption with those in the lowest quintile of both food groups, the prevalence odds ratio was 0.23 (95 % CI 0.10, 0.55; P = 0.001), after adjusting for risk factors for hypertension and other dietary exposures.

[Influence of rs670 variant of APOA1 gene on serum HDL response to an enriched-polyunsaturated vs. an enriched-monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet].,de Luis Román DA; Izaola Jáuregui O; Primo D; Aller R,"Background and objectives: genetic variants of the APOA1 gene have been related to lipid profile in obese subjects. Our aim was to analyze the effects of the rs670 APOA1 gene polymorphism on metabolic changes secondary to an enriched-polyunsaturated fat vs. an enriched-monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet. Methods: 360 Caucasian obese subjects were randomly allocated to two groups. One group received an enriched-polyunsaturated fat (diet P) and the other an enriched-monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet (diet M) during 12 weeks. The effects on serum biomarkers related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were evaluated before and after the dietary intervention. Results: after both diets, body mass index, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, plasma leptin concentration, and waist circumference decreased in all patients. After 12 weeks of intervention with diet P, plasma insulin levels and HOMA-IR decreased in A-allele carriers: delta: -7.3 ± 2.2 IU/L (p = 0.01), and delta: -2.8 ± 0.5 units (p = 0.02), respectively. The same changes in delta were observed after diet M in A-allele carriers: insulin delta: -5.9 ± 1.2 IU/L (p = 0.01), and HOMA-IR delta: -2.1 ± 0.8 units (p = 0.02). In A-allele carriers, LDL-cholesterol decreased and HDL-cholesterol increased after the dietary intervention with diet P: delta: -12.1 ± 4.3 mg/dL (p = 0.01), and delta: 2.6 ± 0.7 mg/dL (p = 0.01), respectively. No differences in lipid profile were observed after diet M. These improvements were not observed in non-A-allele carriers after both interventions. Conclusions: our study showed the association of the rs670 ApoA1 polymorphism with insulin resistance changes as induced by both diets.

A gene variation (rs12691) in the CCAT/enhancer binding protein α modulates glucose metabolism in metabolic syndrome.,Delgado-Lista J; Perez-Martinez P; Garcia-Rios A; Phillips CM; Hall W; Gjelstad IM; Lairon D; Saris W; Kieć-Wilk B; Karlström B; Drevon CA; Defoort C; Blaak EE; Dembinska-Kieć A; Risérus U; Lovegrove JA; Roche HM; Lopez-Miranda J,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) is a transcription factor involved in adipogenesis and energy homeostasis. Caloric restriction reduces CEBPA protein expression in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). A previous report linked rs12691 SNP in CEBPA to altered concentration of fasting triglycerides. Our objective was to assess the effects of rs12691 in glucose metabolism in Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Glucose metabolism was assessed by static (glucose, insulin, adiponectin, leptin and resistin plasma concentrations) and dynamic (disposition index, insulin sensitivity index, HOMA-IR and acute insulin response to glucose) indices, performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of 4 dietary interventions (high saturated fatty acid (SFA), high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), low-fat and low-fat-high-n3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)) in 486 subjects with MetS. Carriers of the minor A allele of rs12691 had altered disposition index (p = 0.0003), lower acute insulin response (p = 0.005) and a lower insulin sensitivity index (p = 0.025) indicating a lower insulin sensitivity and a lower insulin secretion, at baseline and at the end of the diets.

"Lipid levels of expeditioners in Antarctica: response to a reduced-fat, oleic acid and carbohydrate-enriched diet.",Taylor DM; Pye CL; Hindson RM; Lugg D; O'Dea K,"The study examined the effects of a reduced-fat, oleic acid and carbohydrate-enriched diet on serum lipid profiles and body weight in the setting of an isolated Australian Antarctic station. A 12-week dietary intervention period was provided for 30 healthy, free-living expeditioners against a background diet typical of the Australian population. The diet tested a ""modified U.S. Dietary Goals"" regimen which increased oleic acid preferentially (29% energy from fat and 46% from carbohydrate, polyunsaturated: monounsaturated: saturated fatty acid ratio [P:M:S] of 0.6:1.3:1.0, 30 g fibre/day, less than 300 mg cholesterol/day). During the intervention period, mean serum HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels remained relatively stable while mean serum total cholesterol (TC) fell significantly (a fall of 0.95 mmol/l, p < 0.05). The mean serum triglyceride (TG) level rose initially (1.44 to 1.64 mmol/l, p < 0.05) but the level returned to baseline (1.41 mmol/l) by the end of the intervention period. The change in TG level was associated with increased dietary carbohydrate but not with changes in body weight, alcohol intake or season. The study demonstrates that a reduced-fat, oleic acid and carbohydrate-enriched diet can result in significant improvements in serum lipid profiles. The diet was acceptable to the subjects and was easily provided in Antarctica with unobtrusive changes to the typical Australian diet.",1995,Oct,Arctic Med Res,54,4,160-9,,,8579665,#6978,Taylor 1995,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Exercise is required for visceral fat loss in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.,Giannopoulou I; Ploutz-Snyder LL; Carhart R; Weinstock RS; Fernhall B; Goulopoulou S; Kanaley JA,"This study examined the effects of aerobic exercise without weight loss, a hypocaloric high monounsaturated fat diet, and diet plus exercise (D+E) on total abdominal and visceral fat loss in obese postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. Thirty-three postmenopausal women (body mass index, 34.6 +/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) were assigned to one of three interventions: a hypocaloric high monounsaturated fat diet alone, exercise alone (EX), and D+E for 14 wk. Aerobic capacity, body composition, abdominal fat distribution (magnetic resonance imaging), glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity were measured pre- and postintervention. Body weight ( approximately 4.5 kg) and percent body fat ( approximately 5%) were decreased (P < 0.05) with the D and D+E intervention, whereas only percent body fat ( approximately 2.3%) decreased with EX. Total abdominal fat and sc adipose tissue (SAT) were reduced with the D and D+E interventions (P < 0.05), whereas visceral adipose tissue (VAT) decreased with the D+E and EX intervention, but not with the D intervention. EX resulted in a reduction in total abdominal fat, VAT, and SAT (P < 0.05) despite the lack of weight loss. The reductions in total abdominal fat and SAT explained 32.7% and 9.7%, respectively, of the variability in the changes in fasting glucose levels, whereas the reductions in VAT explained 15.9% of the changes in fasting insulin levels (P < 0.05). In conclusion, modest weight loss, through either D or D+E, resulted in similar improvements in total abdominal fat, SAT, and glycemic status in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes; however, the addition of exercise to diet is necessary for VAT loss. These data demonstrate the importance of exercise in the treatment of women with type 2 diabetes.",2005,Mar,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,90,3,1511-8,,10.1210/jc.2004-1782,15598677,#6988,Giannopoulou 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: According to a randomized crossover design, 18 type 2 diabetic patients (aged 59 +/- 5 years; BMI 27 +/- 3 kg/m(2)) (means +/- SD) in satisfactory blood glucose control on diet or diet plus metformin followed a diet relatively rich in carbohydrates (52% total energy), rich in fiber (28 g/1,000 kcal), and with a low glycemic index (58%) (high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet) or a diet relatively low in carbohydrate (45%) and rich in monounsaturated fat (23%) (low-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated fat diet) for 4 weeks. Thereafter, they shifted to the other diet for 4 more weeks. At the end of each period, plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, and lipoprotein fractions (separated by discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation) were determined on blood samples taken at fasting and over 6 h after a test meal having a similar composition as the corresponding diet. RESULTS: In addition to a significant decrease in postprandial plasma glucose, insulin responses, and glycemic variability, the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet also significantly improved the primary end point, since it reduced the postprandial incremental areas under the curve (IAUCs) of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, in particular, chylomicrons (cholesterol IAUC: 0.05 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.02 mmol/l per 6 h; triglycerides IAUC: 0.71 +/- 0.35 vs. 1.03 +/- 0.58 mmol/l per 6 h, P < 0.05).

Reduction of plasma cholesterol levels in normal men on an American Heart Association Step 1 diet or a Step 1 diet with added monounsaturated fat.,Ginsberg HN; Barr SL; Gilbert A; Karmally W; Deckelbaum R; Kaplan K; Ramakrishnan R; Holleran S; Dell RB,"The design of diets to achieve optimal changes in plasma lipid levels is controversial. In a randomized, double-blind trial involving 36 healthy young men, we evaluated the effects on plasma lipid levels of both an American Heart Association Step 1 diet (in which 30 percent of the total calories were consumed as fat: 10 percent saturated, 10 percent monounsaturated, and 10 percent polyunsaturated fats, with 250 mg of cholesterol per day) and a monounsaturated fat-enriched Step 1 diet (with 38 percent of the calories consumed as fat: 10 percent saturated, 18 percent monounsaturated, and 10 percent polyunsaturated fats, with 250 mg of cholesterol per day). The effects of these diets were then compared with those of an average American diet, in which 38 percent of the total calories were consumed as fat: 18 percent saturated, 10 percent monounsaturated, and 10 percent polyunsaturated fats, with 500 mg of cholesterol per day. The men consumed the average American diet for 10 weeks before random assignment to one of the two Step 1 diets or to continuation of the average diet for an additional 10 weeks. Caloric intake was adjusted to maintain a constant body weight. As compared with the mean (+/- SD) change in the plasma total cholesterol level in the group that followed the average American diet throughout the study (-0.05 +/- 0.36 mmol per liter), there were statistically significant reductions (P less than 0.025) in the plasma total cholesterol level in the group on the Step 1 diet (-0.37 +/- 0.27 mmol per liter) and in the group on the monounsaturated fat-enriched Step 1 diet (-0.46 +/- 0.36 mmol per liter). There were parallel reductions in the plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in these two groups. Neither the plasma triglyceride levels nor the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations changed significantly with any diet.

Furthermore, we observed a postprandial decrease in this protein with the HMUFA diet compared with the HSFA and LFHCC diets (p < 0.05). The postprandial response of inhibitory molecule from NF-kB mRNA levels increased with the HMUFA diet compared with the HSFA and LFHCC n-3 diets (p < 0.05). Postprandial tumor necrosis factor-α and Metalloproteinase 9 mRNA levels were also reduced after the HMUFA diet compared with the HSFA diet (p < 0.05).

Effects of moderate-fat (from monounsaturated fat) and low-fat weight-loss diets on the serum lipid profile in overweight and obese men and women.,Pelkman CL; Fishell VK; Maddox DH; Pearson TA; Mauger DT; Kris-Etherton PM,"BACKGROUND: Little evidence of the effects of moderate-fat (from monounsaturated fat) weight-loss diets on risk factors for cardiovascular disease exists because low-fat diets are typically recommended. Previous studies in weight-stable persons showed that a moderate-fat diet results in a more favorable lipid and lipoprotein profile (ie, lower serum triacylglycerol and higher HDL cholesterol) than does a low-fat diet. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of energy-controlled, low-fat and moderate-fat diets on changes in lipids and lipoproteins during weight loss and subsequent weight maintenance. DESIGN: We conducted a parallel-arm study design in overweight and obese [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 29.8 +/- 2.4] healthy men and women (n = 53) assigned to consume a low-fat (18% of energy) or moderate-fat (33% of energy) diet for 6 wk to achieve weight loss, which was followed by 4 wk of weight maintenance. All foods were provided and body weight was monitored to ensure equal weight loss between groups. RESULTS: The moderate-fat diet elicited favorable changes in the lipoprotein profile. Compared with baseline, HDL cholesterol was unchanged, whereas triacylglycerol and the ratios of total and non-HDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol were lower at the end of the weight-maintenance period in the moderate-fat diet group. Despite similar weight loss, triacylglycerol rebounded, HDL cholesterol decreased, and the ratios of total and non-HDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol did not change during the 10-wk interval in the low-fat diet group. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate-fat weight-loss and weight-maintenance diet improves the cardiovascular disease risk profile on the basis of favorable changes in lipids and lipoproteins. There is merit in recommending a moderate-fat weight-loss diet.",2004,Feb,Am J Clin Nutr,79,2,204-12,,10.1093/ajcn/79.2.204,14749224,#7039,Pelkman 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Similar prediction of total mortality, diabetes incidence and cardiovascular events using relative- and absolute-component Mediterranean diet score: the SUN cohort.",Domínguez LJ; Bes-Rastrollo M; de la Fuente-Arrillaga C; Toledo E; Beunza JJ; Barbagallo M; Martínez-González MA,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Accumulated evidence supports the effectiveness of Mediterranean-type diets (MeDiet) in reducing mortality and preventing several chronic diseases. Widely used scores to assess adherence to MeDiet are based on specific sample characteristics; alternatively, they might be built according to absolute/normative cut-off points for the consumption of specific food groups (pre-defined servings/day or/week). The aim of this study was to compare sample-specific MeDiet adherence scores (MDS) versus absolute-normative scores (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener - MEDAS) on their association with macronutrient intake, total mortality and incidence of chronic diseases. DESIGN: SUN (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra) dynamic prospective cohort study (60.5% women; mean age 38.4 years). METHODS AND RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses (n=20,155) we evaluated macronutrient distribution according to MDS (based on 136-item FFQ), MEDAS (based on 13 questions), and variants of both. In prospective analyses (n=9109; mean follow-up: 6.2 years), we evaluated disease incidence or mortality. Adherence to MeDiet increased with age and, as expected, was associated with higher fiber intake, lower total fat intake but higher monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio, using all scores. Among subjects initially free of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), adherence to MeDiet appraised with an absolute-normative score (MEDAS) similarly predicted macronutrient distribution and disease incidence or mortality (diabetes incidence, CVD or all-cause mortality), when compared to a sample-specific score based on 136-item FFQ (MDS).

Consumption of Monounsaturated Fatty Acids Is Associated with Improved Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Four African-Origin Populations Spanning the Epidemiologic Transition.,Mehta S; Ruth Dugas L; Choo-Kang C; Bovet P; Forrester T; Bedu-Addo K; Lambert EV; Plange-Rhule J; Riesen W; Korte W; Luke A,"Long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are of increasing interest because of their favorable effect on cardiometabolic risk. This study explores the association between omega 6 and 3 fatty acids intake and cardiometabolic risk in four African-origin populations spanning the epidemiological transition. Data are obtained from a cohort of 2500 adults aged 25-45 enrolled in the Modeling the Epidemiologic Transition Study (METS), from the US, Ghana, Jamaica, and the Seychelles. Dietary intake was measured using two 24 h recalls from the Nutrient Data System for Research (NDSR). The prevalence of cardiometabolic risk was analyzed by comparing the lowest and highest quartile of omega-3 (EPA+ DHA) consumption and by comparing participants who consumed a ratio of arachidonic acid (AA)/EPA + DHA ≤4:1 and >4:1. Data were analyzed using multiple variable logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, activity, calorie intake, alcohol intake, and smoking status. The lowest quartile of EPA + DHA intake is associated with cardiometabolic risk 2.16 (1.45, 3.2), inflammation 1.59 (1.17, 2.16), and obesity 2.06 (1.50, 2.82). Additionally, consuming an AA/EPA + DHA ratio of >4:1 is also associated with cardiometabolic risk 1.80 (1.24, 2.60), inflammation 1.47 (1.06, 2.03), and obesity 1.72 (1.25, 2.39). Our findings corroborate previous research supporting a beneficial role for monounsaturated fatty acids in reducing cardiometabolic risk.",2021,Jul,Nutrients,13,7,,,10.3390/nu13072442,34371950,#7082,Mehta 2021,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Older Australians Can Achieve High Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet during a 6 Month Randomised Intervention; Results from the Medley Study.,Davis C; Hodgson J; Bryan J; Garg M; Woodman R; Murphy K,"Adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is thought to be achievable in non-Mediterranean regions, but this has yet to be investigated. We aimed to determine if an older Australian population could adhere to a MedDiet for six months. We conducted a randomised, parallel dietary intervention trial with two dietary arms: the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) group and the habitual diet (HabDiet) control group. A 15-point Mediterranean diet adherence score and food and nutrient intakes were estimated from three-day weighed food records collected at baseline, two and four months. Erythrocyte fatty acids, serum carotenoids and urinary metabolites were assessed at baseline, three and six months. We enrolled 166 participants; 152 commenced and 137 completed the study (70 in the MedDiet group, 67 in the HabDiet group). Adherence scores were significantly higher in the MedDiet group at two months (between group difference 2.2, 95% CI 1.3, 2.9) and four months (between group difference 2.6, 95% CI 1.9, 3.3). Consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish, legumes, nuts and olive oil significantly increased in the MedDiet group compared to the control, and discretionary food intake decreased (p < 0.01). Measures of compliance including serum β-carotene, lycopene and erythrocyte monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly higher in the MedDiet group at three and six months (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that a population of older Australians can adopt a Mediterranean diet over a six month period.",2017,May,Nutrients,9,6,,,10.3390/nu9060534,28538676,#7084,Davis 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fat differentially influences the lipids storage on the adipose tissue in metabolic syndrome patients.,Camargo A; Meneses ME; Perez-Martinez P; Delgado-Lista J; Jimenez-Gomez Y; Cruz-Teno C; Tinahones FJ; Paniagua JA; Perez-Jimenez F; Roche HM; Malagon MM; Lopez-Miranda J,"PURPOSE: Adipose tissue is now recognized as a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ. Our aim was to investigate the effect of the dietary fat on the two main adipose tissue functions, endocrine and lipid store, by analyzing the adipose tissue gene expression from metabolic syndrome patients. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial conducted within the LIPGENE study assigned 39 metabolic syndrome patients to 1 of 4 isoenergetic diets: (1) high-saturated fatty acid (HSFA), (2) high-monounsaturated fatty acid (HMUFA), (3) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with long-chain n-3 fatty acids (LFHCC n-3), and (4) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with placebo (LFHCC), for 12 weeks each. A fat challenge reflecting the fatty acid composition as the original diets was conducted post-intervention. RESULTS: The long-term consumption of HSFA, LFHCC, and LFHCC n-3 diets, but not HMUFA diet, decreased the perilipin fasting mRNA levels. LFHCC diet consumption increased fasting FABP4 expression, while it was reduced by the consumption of LFHCC n-3 diet. LFHCC meal reduced, while LFHCC n-3 meal intake increased postprandial CAV1 expression.

Differences in the metabolism of postprandial lipoproteins after a high-monounsaturated-fat versus a high-carbohydrate diet in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,Georgopoulos A; Bantle JP; Noutsou M; Swaim WR; Parker SJ,"There is little information comparing the effects of a high-monounsaturated (Mono)-fat versus a high-carbohydrate (CHO) diet in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the present study, the effects of these diets on a number of metabolic parameters were compared. Seventeen normolipidemic, nonobese patients with type 1 diabetes were provided with the diets for 4 weeks each in a randomized, crossover design. The percentages of Mono fat of the two diets were 25 Mono versus 9 CHO, with a corresponding total fat content of 40% versus 24% and a total CHO content of 45% versus 61%. At the end of each dietary period, parameters of glycemic control, coagulation factors, and fasting and postprandial lipoproteins were assessed. There were no differences in weight, glycemia, insulin dose, fasting lipid profile, or coagulation factors between the two diets. However, the metabolism of postprandial lipoproteins after a fat load differed; viz, after the Mono diet compared with the CHO diet, mean plasma triglyceride levels over 10 hours were higher (P=.0025, by repeated-measures ANOVA). The levels of triglyceride (P=.0045) and retinyl esters (P=.0046) in chylomicrons (Sf>400) and chylomicron remnants (Sf 100 to 400) (P=.0047 and P=.043, respectively), and the total particle number (apolipoprotein B levels) in chylomicron remnants (P=.001) and small, very low density lipoprotein (Sf 20 to 100, P=.016) were also higher. Our data suggest that in patients with type 1 diabetes, a CHO diet might be preferable to a Mono diet, since adherence to the former results in a lower number of circulating postprandial lipoprotein particles that are potentially atherogenic.",1998,May,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,18,5,773-82,,10.1161/01.atv.18.5.773,9598837,#7107,Georgopoulos 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Plasma leptin and hunger ratings in healthy humans.,Joannic JL; Oppert JM; Lahlou N; Basdevant A; Auboiron S; Raison J; Bornet F; Guy-Grand B,"Leptin, the ob gene product, is considered as a signal involved in the regulation of energy stores through centrally mediated effects on ingestive behavior and metabolism. To investigate the relationships between appetite-related sensations and circulating leptin in humans, 12 healthy male volunteers were served two test lunches (1200 kcal, 38% carbohydrate, 50% fat, 12% protein) with comparable palatability but resulting in different postprandial hunger ratings, and plasma leptin concentrations were monitored during 8 h after meal ingestion. Whereas postprandial hunger ratings (assessed by visual analog scales) and plasma insulin patterns differed significantly between meals, no significant difference in postprandial plasma leptin concentrations was observed between the two meals. A moderate but significant increase in mean plasma leptin was found over time. We conclude that postprandial plasma leptin concentrations do not significantly differ between two meals inducing different effects on hunger subjective feelings. These data are in agreement with a role for leptin in the regulation of energy balance as a long-term adiposity-related signal rather than a short-term meal-related factor.",1998,Apr,Appetite,30,2,129-38,,10.1006/appe.1997.0112,9573448,#7112,Joannic 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Monounsaturated diet lowers LDL oxidisability in type IIb and type IV dyslipidemia without affecting coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E contents.,Svegliati Baroni S; Amelio M; Fiorito A; Gaddi A; Littarru G; Battino M,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of MUFA vs PUFA enriched diets on the plasma and LDL lipid profile and antioxidant contents in mild hypercholesterolemic and triglyceridemic subjects. The study was divided in two consecutive diet periods. Two groups of 11 dyslipidemic patients each (type IIb and type IV) were recruited and during the first period (lasting four weeks) received a linoleic rich diet while during the following four weeks took an oleate rich diet. Both groups showed no significant changes in cholesterol and TG concentration either in plasma or in LDL. Coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E were also unaffected by the dietary treatments. LDL proneness to be oxidatively modified increased after dietary PUFA administration and markedly decreased following the virgin olive oil enriched diet. In fact, LDL from hypertrigliceridemic subjects on a oleate-enriched diet displayed a 26% (p < 0.05) longer lag-phase in conjugated dienes generation than during linoleate-enriched diet and at recruitment. In hypercholesterolemic subjects similar results were obtained: the lag-phase was 28% longer after MUFA diet that after PUFA diet. No differences were found in the maximum propagation rate and maximum concentration of conjugated dienes among dietary periods and at recruitment. Since we found that the vit. E and CoQ10 levels in plasma and in LDL particles remained unchanged during the course of the study, we may conclude that LDL proneness to undergo oxidative modifications is mainly the result of compositional change due to the enrichment from the different diets of the relative fats.",1999,,Biofactors,9,4-Feb,325-30,,10.1002/biof.5520090231,10416048,#7146,SvegliatiBaroni 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

Mean plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein total mass (analytic ultracentrifuge), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and HDL total mass, did not change significantly on exchanging fat type. However, HDL2 cholesterol concentration was 50% higher and HDL3 cholesterol concentration was 7% lower for polyunsaturated compared with monounsaturated fat. Mean total mass of HDL2 was also 23.5% higher and concentration of apolipoprotein B was 5.4% lower on transfer to the polyunsaturated fat diet. Contrary to frequent assertions, we find no advantage with respect to plasma HDL concentrations in using predominantly monounsaturated rather than polyunsaturated fats in subjects who consumed reduced-fat, solid-food diets.",1990,May,JAMA,263,18,2462-6,,,2329634,#7150,Dreon 1990,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Polyunsaturated fatty acids acutely suppress antibodies to malondialdehyde-modified lipoproteins in patients with vascular disease.,Gradek WQ; Harris MT; Yahia N; Davis WW; Le NA; Brown WV,"Antibodies to malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are transiently reduced during the postprandial period in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease. Previous experiments using mixed meals high in fat have found reductions of approximately 20% within 2 hours. This study was designed to reveal if this phenomenon was due uniquely to saturated fats. Using a standardized immunoassay for the detection of circulating levels of autoantibodies (AAbs) against MDA-modified LDL, we examined the acute changes in AAb levels during 6 hours of postprandial lipemia in 10 men with known atherosclerotic heart disease. Each subject was given 4 meals 1 week apart. Three of the meals differed in content of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and polyunsaturated fat. A fat-free meal with equivalent carbohydrate and equivalent protein was also administered. The study was double blinded and the meals were administered in random order. Only the meal enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids caused the reduction in antibodies to MDA-LDL. This decrease was statistically significant from baseline at 1 hour (p <0.05), 2 hours (p <0.004), and 3 hours (p <0.02), with the nadir occurring at 2 hours. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are the major stimulus for causing a reduction in the AAbs to MDA-LDL during postprandial lipemia.

Anthropometric measurements, an assessment of nutritional intake, and biochemical tests were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Weight loss was similar with both diets. After Diet M, only subjects with CC genotype showed significant improvements in total cholesterol (CC vs. CG±GG) (-9.0±1.1mU/L vs. -4.5±2.4mg/dL, p=0.01), LDL cholesterol (-6.0±1.1mg/dL vs. -3.0±0.9mg/dL, p=0.03), glucose (-4.7±1.1mg/dL vs. -0.6±0.5mg/dL, p=0.01), and insulin levels (-2.6±1.0mU/L vs. -0.7±0.3mU/L, p=0.02) and in HOMA-IR (-0.5±0.2 units vs. -0.2±0.4 units, p=0.03).

Effects of a monounsaturated fatty acid-enriched hypocaloric diet on cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.,Gumbiner B; Low CC; Reaven PD,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the lipoprotein response to weight loss in obese patients with type 2 diabetes can be improved by modifying the macronutrient composition of the commonly prescribed low-fat, high-carbohydrate (CHO) hypocaloric diet. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-enriched weight-reducing formula diet and compared with eight obese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with a low-fat, high-CHO weight-reducing formula diet. Weight loss ensued for 6 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of refeeding using isocaloric formulas enriched with MUFA or CHO, respectively. Fasting blood samples were obtained to measure plasma lipoproteins and LDL susceptibility to oxidation (measured as lag time: time required to induce in vitro formation of conjugated dienes). RESULTS: At baseline, there were no differences between the groups in plasma lipids, lipoproteins, or LDL susceptibility to oxidation. Weight loss was similar between the groups. Dieting resulted in decreases in total plasma cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins A and B (P < 0.05), but the MUFA group manifested a greater decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B and a smaller decrease in HDL and apolipoprotein A than the CHO group (P < 0.05). Improvements in these parameters were sustained during refeeding. After dieting, lag time was prolonged in the MUFA group (208 +/- 10 min) compared with the CHO group (146 +/- 11 min; P < 0.05). Lag time was prolonged further during refeeding in the MUFA group (221 +/- 13 min, P = 0.10), while the CHO group remained unchanged (152 +/- 9 min, P < 0.05). Lag time correlated strongly with the oleic acid content of LDL after dieting and refeeding (r = 0.74 and r = 0.93, respectively; both P < 0.001).

Clustering effects on postprandial insulin secretion and sensitivity in response to meals with different fatty acid compositions.,Bermudez B; Ortega-Gomez A; Varela LM; Villar J; Abia R; Muriana FJ; Lopez S,"Dietary fatty acids play a role in glucose homeostasis. The aim of this study was to assess the individual relationship between dietary saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids with postprandial β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides. We assessed postprandial β-cell function (by the insulinogenic index and the ratio of the insulin to glucose areas under the time-concentration curve) and insulin sensitivity (by the oral glucose and the minimal model insulin sensitivity indices) over four nonconsecutive, randomly assigned, high-fat meals containing a panel of SFA (palmitic and stearic acids), MUFA (palmitoleic and oleic acids) and PUFA (linoleic and α-linolenic acids) in 14 subjects with normal and in 14 subjects with high fasting triglycerides. The proportions of each fatty acid in the meals and the values for surrogate measures of postprandial β-cell function and insulin sensitivity were subjected to a Pearson correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis, which revealed two classes of dietary fatty acids for regulating postprandial glucose homeostasis. We successfully discriminated the adverse effects of SFA palmitic acid from the beneficial effects of MUFA oleic acid on postprandial β-cell function (r ≥ 0.84 for SFA palmitic acid and r ≥ -0.71 for MUFA oleic acid; P < 0.05) and insulin sensitivity (r ≥ -0.92 for SFA palmitic acid and r ≥ 0.89 for MUFA oleic acid; P < 0.001) both in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides.

Return of hunger following a relatively high carbohydrate breakfast is associated with earlier recorded glucose peak and nadir.,Chandler-Laney PC; Morrison SA; Goree LL; Ellis AC; Casazza K; Desmond R; Gower BA,"The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that a breakfast meal with high carbohydrate/low fat results in an earlier increase in postprandial glucose and insulin, a greater decrease below baseline in postprandial glucose, and an earlier return of appetite, compared with a low carbohydrate/high fat meal. Overweight but otherwise healthy adults (n = 64) were maintained on one of two eucaloric diets: high carbohydrate/low fat (HC/LF; 55:27:18% kcals from carbohydrate:fat:protein) versus low carbohydrate/high fat (LC/HF; 43:39:18% kcals from carbohydrate:fat:protein). After 4 weeks of acclimation to the diets, participants underwent a meal test during which circulating glucose and insulin and self-reported hunger and fullness, were measured before and after consumption of breakfast from their assigned diets. The LC/HF meal resulted in a later time at the highest and lowest recorded glucose, higher glucose concentrations at 3 and 4 hours post meal, and lower insulin incremental area under the curve. Participants consuming the LC/HF meal reported lower appetite 3 and 4 hours following the meal, a response that was associated with the timing of the highest and lowest recorded glucose. Modest increases in meal carbohydrate content at the expense of fat content may facilitate weight gain over the long-term by contributing to an earlier rise and fall of postprandial glucose concentrations and an earlier return of appetite.",2014,Sep,Appetite,80,,236-41,,10.1016/j.appet.2014.04.031,24819342,#7208,Chandler-Laney 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
A high carbohydrate versus a high monounsaturated fatty acid diet lowers the atherogenic potential of big VLDL particles in patients with type 1 diabetes.,Georgopoulos A; Bantle JP; Noutsou M; Hoover HA,"The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of two diets on the atherogenic potential of two VLDL subfractions harvested from fasting subjects by measuring the number and composition of particles and the amount of esterified cholesterol accumulated in macrophages.

The two diets were matched for protein, polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids, cholesterol and fiber content. The number of circulating big VLDL (S:(f) 100-400) particles was greater during the high Mono than during the high CHO diet based on the levels of apolipoprotein B (means +/- SEM): 31.4 +/- 7.4 versus 20.0 +/- 3.8 mg/L (P: < 0.025, paired t test). The following variables did not differ during the diet periods: number of small VLDL (S:(f) 20-100) particles, esterified cholesterol accumulated in THP-1 macrophages incubated with the same number of big and small VLDL particles and particle composition.

Dietary intakes of cholesterol and fatty acids were derived from a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and the Singapore Food Composition Table. Incident PD cases were identified either through follow-up interviews or record linkage analysis with hospital discharge and PD outpatient registries. RESULTS: After an average of 14.6 years, 218 men and 193 women in the cohort developed PD. Dietary cholesterol was associated with statistically significantly lower risk of PD in a dose-dependent manner among men after adjustment for established risk factors for PD and intakes of major fatty acids. Compared to the lowest quartile, HR (95% CI) for the highest quartile was 0.53 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.84) (P for trend=0.006). Among women, dietary monounsaturated fatty acid was inversely associated with PD risk (P for trend=0.033). Compared to the lowest quartile, HR for the highest quartile was 0.44 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.88). There was no statistically significant association between dietary saturated, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids and PD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intakes of cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids may reduce risk of PD in men and women, respectively.",2016,Jan,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,87,1,86-92,,10.1136/jnnp-2014-310065,25669745,#7253,Tan 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Effects of protein, monounsaturated fat, and carbohydrate intake on blood pressure and serum lipids: results of the OmniHeart randomized trial.",Appel LJ; Sacks FM; Carey VJ; Obarzanek E; Swain JF; Miller ER 3rd; Conlin PR; Erlinger TP; Rosner BA; Laranjo NM; Charleston J; McCarron P; Bishop LM,"CONTEXT: Reduced intake of saturated fat is widely recommended for prevention of cardiovascular disease. The type of macronutrient that should replace saturated fat remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 3 healthful diets, each with reduced saturated fat intake, on blood pressure and serum lipids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, 3-period, crossover feeding study (April 2003 to June 2005) conducted in Baltimore, Md, and Boston, Mass. Participants were 164 adults with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. Each feeding period lasted 6 weeks and body weight was kept constant. INTERVENTIONS: A diet rich in carbohydrates; a diet rich in protein, about half from plant sources; and a diet rich in unsaturated fat, predominantly monounsaturated fat. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. RESULTS: Blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and estimated coronary heart disease risk were lower on each diet compared with baseline. Compared with the carbohydrate diet, the protein diet further decreased mean systolic blood pressure by 1.4 mm Hg (P = .002) and by 3.5 mm Hg (P = .006) among those with hypertension and decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 3.3 mg/dL (0.09 mmol/L; P = .01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 1.3 mg/dL (0.03 mmol/L; P = .02), and triglycerides by 15.7 mg/dL (0.18 mmol/L; P<.001). Compared with the carbohydrate diet, the unsaturated fat diet decreased systolic blood pressure by 1.3 mm Hg (P = .005) and by 2.9 mm Hg among those with hypertension (P = .02), had no significant effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 1.1 mg/dL (0.03 mmol/L; P = .03), and lowered triglycerides by 9.6 mg/dL (0.11 mmol/L; P = .02). Compared with the carbohydrate diet, estimated 10-year coronary heart disease risk was lower and similar on the protein and unsaturated fat diets. CONCLUSION: In the setting of a healthful diet, partial substitution of carbohydrate with either protein or monounsaturated fat can further lower blood pressure, improve lipid levels, and reduce estimated cardiovascular risk.

Insulin resistance determines a differential response to changes in dietary fat modification on metabolic syndrome risk factors: the LIPGENE study.,Yubero-Serrano EM; Delgado-Lista J; Tierney AC; Perez-Martinez P; Garcia-Rios A; Alcala-Diaz JF; Castaño JP; Tinahones FJ; Drevon CA; Defoort C; Blaak EE; Dembinska-Kieć A; Risérus U; Lovegrove JA; Perez-Jimenez F; Roche HM; Lopez-Miranda J,"BACKGROUND: Previous data support the benefits of reducing dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) on insulin resistance (IR) and other metabolic risk factors. However, whether the IR status of those suffering from metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects this response is not established. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether the degree of IR influences the effect of substituting high-saturated fatty acid (HSFA) diets by isoenergetic alterations in the quality and quantity of dietary fat on MetS risk factors. DESIGN: In this single-blind, parallel, controlled, dietary intervention study, MetS subjects (n = 472) from 8 European countries classified by different IR levels according to homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were randomly assigned to 4 diets: an HSFA diet; a high-monounsaturated fatty acid (HMUFA) diet; a low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate (LFHCC) diet supplemented with long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (1.2 g/d); or an LFHCC diet supplemented with placebo for 12 wk (control). Anthropometric, lipid, inflammatory, and IR markers were determined. RESULTS: Insulin-resistant MetS subjects with the highest HOMA-IR improved IR, with reduced insulin and HOMA-IR concentrations after consumption of the HMUFA and LFHCC n-3 diets (P < 0.05). In contrast, subjects with lower HOMA-IR showed reduced body mass index and waist circumference after consumption of the LFHCC control and LFHCC n-3 diets and increased HDL cholesterol concentrations after consumption of the HMUFA and HSFA diets (P < 0.05). MetS subjects with a low to medium HOMA-IR exhibited reduced blood pressure, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol levels after the LFHCC n-3 diet and increased apolipoprotein A-I concentrations after consumption of the HMUFA and HSFA diets (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin-resistant MetS subjects with more metabolic complications responded differently to dietary fat modification, being more susceptible to a health effect from the substitution of SFAs in the HMUFA and LFHCC n-3 diets. Conversely, MetS subjects without IR may be more sensitive to the detrimental effects of HSFA intake. The metabolic phenotype of subjects clearly determines response to the quantity and quality of dietary fat on MetS risk factors, which suggests that targeted and personalized dietary therapies may be of value for its different metabolic features.

The high-monounsaturated fat diet as a practical alternative for NIDDM.,Campbell LV; Marmot PE; Dyer JA; Borkman M; Storlien LH,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the dietary preferences of and metabolic effects in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) of a home-prepared high-monounsaturated fat (HM) diet compared with the recommended high-carbohydrate (CHO) diet. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten men with mild NIDDM prepared HM and high-CHO diets at home alternately and in random order for 2 weeks each with a minimum 1-week washout. Before and after each diet, 24-h urine glucose, fasting lipids, fructosamine, and 6-h profiles of glucose, insulin, and triglycerides were measured. Dietary preferences were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: In the HM diet, patients consumed 40% of energy intake as CHO and 38% as fat (21% monounsaturated) compared with 52 and 24%, respectively, in the high-CHO diet, with equal dietary fiber content. Body weight and total energy intake were similar in both. The HM diet resulted in significantly lower 24-h urinary glucose excretion, fasting triglyceride, and mean profile glucose levels. The fructosamine levels, the fasting total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the prandial triglyceride concentrations did not differ significantly as a result of the diets. The two diets did not differ in ratings for overall acceptance, taste, cost, ease of preparation, variety, or satiety. CONCLUSIONS: Prepared at home, the HM diet was, in the short-term, metabolically better in some aspects than the currently recommended diet for NIDDM. It also provided a palatable alternative.",1994,Mar,Diabetes Care,17,3,177-82,,10.2337/diacare.17.3.177,8174444,#7288,Campbell 1994,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Postprandial inflammatory response in adipose tissue of patients with metabolic syndrome after the intake of different dietary models.,Meneses ME; Camargo A; Perez-Martinez P; Delgado-Lista J; Cruz-Teno C; Jimenez-Gomez Y; Paniagua JA; Gutierrez-Mariscal FM; Tinahones FJ; Vidal-Puig A; Roche HM; Perez-Jimenez F; Malagon MM; Lopez-Miranda J,"SCOPE: Dysfunctional adipose tissue may be an important trigger of molecular inflammatory pathways that cause cardiovascular diseases. Our aim was to determine whether the specific quality and quantity of dietary fat produce differential postprandial inflammatory responses in adipose tissue from metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized, controlled trial conducted within the LIPGENE study assigned MetS patients to 1 of 4 diets: (i) high-saturated fatty acid (HSFA), (ii) high-monounsaturated fatty acid (HMUFA), (iii) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (LFHCC n-3), and (iv) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with placebo (LFHCC), for 12 wk each. A fat challenge reflecting the fatty acid composition as the original diets was conducted post-intervention. We found that p65 gene expression is induced in adipose tissue (p=0.003) at the postprandial state. In addition, IκBα (p<0.001), MCP-1 (p<0.001) and IL-1β (p<0.001) gene expression was equally induced in the postprandial state, regardless of the quality and quantity of the dietary fat. Notably, IL-6 transcripts were only detected in the postprandial state.

Long-term weight maintenance and cardiovascular risk factors are not different following weight loss on carbohydrate-restricted diets high in either monounsaturated fat or protein in obese hyperinsulinaemic men and women.,Keogh JB; Luscombe-Marsh ND; Noakes M; Wittert GA; Clifton PM,"The aim of this study was to determine after 52 weeks whether advice to follow a lower carbohydrate diet, either high in monounsaturated fat or low fat, high in protein had differential effects in a free-living community setting. Following weight loss on either a high monounsaturated fat, standard protein (HMF; 50 % fat, 20 % protein (67 g/d), 30 % carbohydrate) or a high protein, moderate fat (HP) (40 % protein (136 g/d), 30 % fat, 30 % carbohydrate) energy-restricted diet (6000 kJ/d) subjects were asked to maintain the same dietary pattern without intensive dietary counselling for the following 36 weeks. Overall weight loss was 6.2 (SD 7.3) kg (P < 0.01 for time with no diet effect, 7.6 (SD 8.1) kg, HMF v. 4.8 (SD 6.6) kg, HP). In a multivariate regression model predictors of weight loss at the end of the study were sex, age and reported percentage energy from protein (R2 0.22, P < 0.05 for the whole model). Fasting plasma insulin decreased (P < 0.01, with no difference between diets), 13.9 (SD 4.6) to 10.2 (SD 5.2) mIU/l, but fasting plasma glucose was not reduced.

Short-term effects of dietary fatty acids on muscle lipid composition and serum acylcarnitine profile in human subjects.,Kien CL; Everingham KI; D Stevens R; Fukagawa NK; Muoio DM,"In cultured cells, palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA) confer distinct metabolic effects, yet, unclear, is whether changes in dietary fat intake impact cellular fatty acid (FA) composition. We hypothesized that short-term increases in dietary PA or OA would result in corresponding changes in the FA composition of skeletal muscle diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) and/or the specific FA selected for β-oxidation. Healthy males (N = 12) and females (N = 12) ingested a low-PA diet for 7 days. After fasting measurements of the serum acylcarnitine (AC) profile, subjects were randomized to either high-PA (HI PA) or low-PA/high-OA (HI OA) diets. After 7 days, the fasting AC measurement was repeated and a muscle/fat biopsy obtained. FA composition of intramyocellular DAG and TAG and serum AC was measured. HI PA increased, whereas HI OA decreased, serum concentration of 16:0 AC (P < 0.001). HI OA increased 18:1 AC (P = 0.005). HI PA was associated with a higher PA/OA ratio in muscle DAG and TAG (DAG: 1.03 ± 0.24 vs. 0.46 ± 0.08, P = 0.04; TAG: 0.63 ± 0.07 vs. 0.41 ± 0.03, P = 0.01). The PA concentration in the adipose tissue DAG (µg/mg adipose tissue) was 0.17 ± 0.02 in those receiving the HI PA diet (n = 6), compared to 0.11 ± 0.02 in the HI OA group (n = 4) (P = 0.067).

Dietary fat and protein intake are not associated with incident biliary sludge and stones during pregnancy.,Mathew LK; Ko C,"BACKGROUND: Dietary composition can cause insulin resistance, elevated serum lipid levels, and obesity, all of which predispose to gallstone formation. The effects of dietary fat (including individual fatty acids) and protein on gallstone formation are controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dietary fat and protein intake on incident gallstone disease during pregnancy, a high-risk time for stone formation. METHODS: We prospectively studied 3070 pregnant women who underwent serial gallbladder ultrasound examinations during pregnancy and at 4-6 weeks postpartum. All women had at least 2 study ultrasounds for comparison. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was completed by subjects in the early third trimester. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the risk of incident gallbladder disease across quartiles of intake of total fat, individual fatty acids (polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, saturated, and total trans-fatty acids, as well as cholesterol), protein, and protein subtype (animal or vegetable based). RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of new biliary sludge/stones or progression of baseline sludge to stones was 10.2% by 4-6 weeks postpartum. There was no association between total dietary fat (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-2.18 comparing lowest and highest quartiles) or protein intake (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.44-1.22 comparing lowest and highest quartiles) and incident gallbladder disease.

Comparison between fat intake assessed by a 3-day food record and phospholipid fatty acid composition of red blood cells: results from the Monitoring of Cardiovascular Disease-Lille Study.,Romon M; Nuttens MC; Théret N; Delbart C; Lecerf JM; Fruchart JC; Salomez JL,"We investigated the relationship between assessment of fatty acid intake by a 3-day food record and by capillary gas chromatography of erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acid. The study was performed in a sample of 244 men aged 45 to 66 years from the general population who were participating in the Monitoring of Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA)-Lille survey. The relationship between each nutrient and food item and erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acid was investigated by a regression model on proportion including each food item and nutrient as a dependent variable and percentage of fatty acid and covariables (nonalcoholic energy intake, age, alcohol intake, and smoking) as independent variables. Polyunsaturated fat and linoleic acid intake were positively correlated with linoleic acid content of erythrocytes (beta = 0.641 and 0.604, respectively, P < .001). Monounsaturated and saturated fat intake were correlated with oleic acid (beta = 0.375 and 0.373, respectively, P < .01). Fish intake correlated positively with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (beta = 0.383, P < .001) and negatively with arachidonic acid (beta = -0.509, P < .01). These data confirm, on a group level, a good relationship between assessment of polyunsaturated fat intake by a 3-day record and linoleic acid content of erythrocyte membranes.

Data from noninvasive TcCO2 monitoring assists with clinical decisions regarding mechanical ventilation settings, estimation of metabolic consumption and determination of adequate end-organ tissue perfusion. OBJECTIVES: To report TcCO2 values obtained from various fruits, vegetables and elite critical care medicine specialists. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, nonblinded cohort study. SETTINGS: Single-centre, tertiary paediatric referral centre and organic farmers' market. PARTICIPANTS: Vegetables and fruits included 10 samples of each of the following: red delicious apple (Malus domestica), manzano banana (Musa sapientum), key lime (Citrus aurantiifolia), miniature sweet bell pepper (Capsicum annuum), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and avocado (Persea americana).

Impact of a high-monounsaturated-fat diet on lipid profile in subjects with type 1 diabetes.,Strychar I; Ishac A; Rivard M; Lussier-Cacan S; Beauregard H; Aris-Jilwan N; Radwan F; Yale JF,"OBJECTIVE: Controversy persists regarding the use of a high-monounsaturated-fat diet in people with type 1 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a high-monounsaturated-fat diet containing 43% to 46% carbohydrates and 37% to 40% fat (17% to 20% monounsaturated fat) with those of a high-carbohydrate diet containing 54% to 57% carbohydrates and 27% to 30% fat (10% to 13% monounsaturated fat) on the quantitative and qualitative lipoprotein profile in type 1 diabetes. DESIGN: A randomized crossover study was conducted. Two months before the dietary trial, subjects were monitored on their intensive insulin regimen to normalize glycemic and lipid levels. SUBJECTS: Twenty-six individuals followed each diet for 2 months. Eight subjects lost or gained >2 kg, and three had the same dietary intakes during the two diets. For the remaining 15, seven adhered to the two diet prescriptions and eight followed one of the two diets. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Analysis of variance for crossover design (intent-to-treat group of 26) and Wilcoxon signed rank test (group of seven) were used to assess differences between the two diets. RESULTS: For the intent-to-treat group (n=26), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, although within normal range, was lower by 7% (P=.034) at the end of the high-monounsaturated-fat diet. The other 17 lipid parameters tested were not statistically significant. For those who adhered to the two diets (n= 7), lower plasma total triglycerides by 18% (P=.027), lower very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides by 26% (P=.043), lower very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 48% (P=.043), higher apolipoprotein A1 by 7% (P=.018), smaller low-density lipoprotein particle size by 1% (P=.043), and longer low-density lipoprotein oxidation lag time by 25% (P=.043) were found after the high-monounsaturated-fat diet.

A Palaeolithic-type diet causes strong tissue-specific effects on ectopic fat deposition in obese postmenopausal women.,Ryberg M; Sandberg S; Mellberg C; Stegle O; Lindahl B; Larsson C; Hauksson J; Olsson T,"OBJECTIVES: Ectopic fat accumulation in liver and skeletal muscle may be an essential link between abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular disease after menopause. We hypothesized that a diet containing a relatively high content of protein and unsaturated fat [mainly monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)] but limited carbohydrates and saturated fat would reduce lipid content in liver and muscle and increase insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal women. SUBJECTS: Ten healthy, nonsmoking postmenopausal women with a body mass index (BMI) >27 (28-35) kg m(-2) were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were instructed to consume an ad libitum Palaeolithic-type diet intended to provide approximately 30 energy percentage (E%) protein, 40 E% fat (mainly MUFAs) and 30 E% carbohydrate. Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) levels in calf muscles and liver triglyceride levels were quantified using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) before and 5 weeks after dietary intervention. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) indices and the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique. RESULTS: Mean energy intake decreased by 25% with a weight loss of 4.5 kg. BMI, waist and hip circumference, waist/hip ratio and abdominal sagittal diameter also decreased significantly, as did diastolic blood pressure (mean -7 mmHg), levels of fasting serum glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL/HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), urinary C-peptide and HOMA indices. Whole-body insulin sensitivity did not change. Liver triglyceride levels decreased by 49%, whereas IMCL levels in skeletal muscle were not significantly altered.

One hundred and sixty five patients (63.9%) had the genotype G1359G and 93 (36.1%) patients (A allele carriers) had G1359A (78 patients,30.3%) or A1359A (15 patients,5.8%) genotypes. In subjects with both genotypes, body mass index, weight, fat mass, waist circumference and systolic blood pressures decreased with both diets. With the diet-type M and in both genotype groups, biochemical parameters remained unchanged. After the diet type P and in subjects with both genotypes, glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, insulin and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels decreased. In G1359G genotype subjects after both diets, leptin levels decreased. The finding of this study is the association of the A allele with a lack of improvement on leptin levels. Subjects with both genotypes and after a high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet showed a significant improvement of LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, HOMA-IR and insulin levels.",2013,Aug,J Nutr Biochem,24,8,1431-5,,10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.12.001,23337343,#7452,deLuis 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of dietary fat modification on subcutaneous white adipose tissue insulin sensitivity in patients with metabolic syndrome.,Jimenez-Gomez Y; Cruz-Teno C; Rangel-Zuñiga OA; Peinado JR; Perez-Martinez P; Delgado-Lista J; Garcia-Rios A; Camargo A; Vazquez-Martinez R; Ortega-Bellido M; Perez-Jimenez F; Roche HM; Malagon MM; Lopez-Miranda J,"SCOPE: To determine whether the insulin resistance that exists in metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients is modulated by dietary fat composition. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were randomly assigned to one of four diets for 12 wk: high-saturated fatty acids (HSFAs), high-MUFA (HMUFA), and two low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate (LFHCC) diets supplemented with long-chain n-3 (LFHCC n-3) PUFA or placebo. At the end of intervention, the LFHCC n-3 diet reduced plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and nonsterified fatty acid concentration (p < 0.05) as compared to baseline Spanish habitual (BSH) diet. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) analysis revealed decreased EH-domain containing-2 mRNA levels and increased cbl-associated protein gene expression with the LFHCC n-3 compared to HSFA and HMUFA diets, respectively (p < 0.05). Moreover, the LFHCC n-3 decreased gene expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with respect to HMUFA and BSH diets (p < 0.05). Finally, proteomic characterization of subcutaneous WAT identified three proteins of glucose metabolism downregulated by the LFHCC n-3 diet, including annexin A2. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the decrease of annexin A2 (p = 0.027) after this diet. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the LFHCC n-3 diet reduces systemic insulin resistance and improves insulin signaling in subcutaneous WAT of MetS patients compared to HSFA and BSH diets consumption.",2014,Nov,Mol Nutr Food Res,58,11,2177-88,,10.1002/mnfr.201300901,25044988,#7461,Jimenez-Gomez 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A crossover design with diet interventions and wash-out periods of 3 wk was applied. The patients were randomly assigned to a 3-wk treatment with a high-carbohydrate diet containing 50% of energy as carbohydrate and 30% of energy as fat (10% of energy as monounsaturated fatty acids) or an isocaloric diet with 30% of energy as carbohydrate and 50% of energy as fat (30% of energy as monounsaturated fatty acids). On the last day of the two diets, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was measured and day profiles of glucose, hormones, and lipids were performed to a test menu rich in carbohydrates. RESULTS: The diet rich in monounsaturated fat reduced daytime systolic (131 +/- 3 vs. 137 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.04) and 24-h systolic blood pressure (126 +/- 8 vs. 130 +/- 10 mmHg, P < 0.03) as well as daytime diastolic (78 +/- 2 vs. 84 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.02) and diurnal diastolic blood pressure (75 +/- 6 vs. 78 +/- 5 mmHg, P < 0.03) as compared with the high-carbohydrate diet. Evidence of lowered blood glucose levels on the high-monounsaturated diet compared with the high-carbohydrate diet were found with lower fasting blood glucose (6.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 6.8 +/- 0.5 mM, P < 0.05), lower average blood glucose levels (7.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 8.2 +/- 0.6 mM, P < 0.04), and peak blood glucose responses (9.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 11.3 +/- 0.7 mM, P < 0.02).

The pathophysiology of these diseases involves free radical mechanisms. Diet may either enhance or diminish oxidative stress in the body. OBJECTIVE: We studied the effects of high and low intakes of vegetables, berries, and apples on markers of lipid peroxidation and lipoprotein metabolism in subjects consuming diets high in linoleic or oleic acid. DESIGN: For 6 wk, healthy men and women (n = 77; aged 19-52 y) consumed 1 of 4 controlled isoenergetic diets rich in either linoleic acid (11% of energy) or oleic acid (12% of energy) and containing either 815 or 170 g vegetables, berries, and apples/10 MJ. Nineteen healthy volunteers served as control subjects. Several markers of dietary compliance (plasma fatty acids, vitamin C, carotenoids, and quercetin), lipid peroxidation [ex vivo LDL oxidation, plasma and LDL thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, paraoxonase (EC 3.1.8.1), and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2)(alpha)], and lipoprotein metabolism (plasma lipids, apolipoproteins, and lipid transfer protein activities) were measured from samples collected before and at the end of the experimental period. RESULTS: Plasma fatty acid composition and antioxidant concentrations showed that compliance with the diets was good. However, there were no significant differences between the diets in the markers of lipid peroxidation and lipoprotein metabolism.

Adverse effects on insulin secretion of replacing saturated fat with refined carbohydrate but not with monounsaturated fat: A randomized controlled trial in centrally obese subjects.,Chang LF; Vethakkan SR; Nesaretnam K; Sanders TA; Teng KT,"BACKGROUND: Current dietary guidelines recommend the replacement of saturated fatty acids (SAFAs) with carbohydrates or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) based on evidence on lipid profile alone, the chronic effects of the mentioned replacements on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are however unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the chronic effects of the substitution of refined carbohydrate or MUFA for SAFA on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in centrally obese subjects. METHODS: Using a crossover design, randomized controlled trial in abdominally overweight men and women, we compared the effects of substitution of 7% energy as carbohydrate or MUFA for SAFA for a period of 6 weeks each. Fasting and postprandial blood samples in response to corresponding SAFA, carbohydrate, or MUFA-enriched meal-challenges were collected after 6 weeks on each diet treatment for the assessment of outcomes. RESULTS: As expected, postprandial nonesterified fatty acid suppression and elevation of C-peptide, insulin and glucose secretion were the greatest with high-carbohydrate (CARB) meal. Interestingly, CARB meal attenuated postprandial insulin secretion corrected for glucose response; however, the insulin sensitivity and disposition index were not affected. SAFA and MUFA had similar effects on all markers except for fasting glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide concentrations, which increased after MUFA but not SAFA when compared with CARB. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a 6-week lower-fat/higher-carbohydrate (increased by 7% refined carbohydrate) diet may have greater adverse effect on insulin secretion corrected for glucose compared with isocaloric higher-fat diets.

Dietary fat may modulate adipose tissue homeostasis through the processes of autophagy and apoptosis.,Camargo A; Rangel-Zúñiga OA; Alcalá-Díaz J; Gomez-Delgado F; Delgado-Lista J; García-Carpintero S; Marín C; Almadén Y; Yubero-Serrano EM; López-Moreno J; Tinahones FJ; Pérez-Martínez P; Roche HM; López-Miranda J,"PURPOSE: Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer development. Autophagy and apoptosis are critical processes for development and homeostasis in multicellular organisms and have been linked to a variety of disorders. We aimed to investigate whether the quantity and quality of dietary fat can influence these processes in the adipose tissue of obese people. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial within the LIPGENE study assigned 39 obese people with metabolic syndrome to 1 of 4 diets: (a) a high-saturated fatty acid diet, (b) a high-monounsaturated fatty acid (HMUFA) diet, and (c, d) two low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets supplemented with long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LFHCC n-3) or placebo (LFHCC), for 12 weeks each. RESULTS: We found an increase in the expression of autophagy-related BECN1 and ATG7 genes after the long-term consumption of the HMUFA diet (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively) and an increase in the expression of the apoptosis-related CASP3 gene after the long-term consumption of the LFHCC and LFHCC n-3 diets (p = 0.001 and p = 0.029, respectively). CASP3 and CASP7 gene expression changes correlated with HOMA index. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the processes of autophagy and apoptosis in adipose tissue may be modified by diet and that the consumption of a diet rich in monounsaturated fat may contribute to adipose tissue homeostasis by increasing autophagy. They also reinforce the notion that apoptosis in adipose tissue is linked to insulin resistance.

Postprandial coagulation factor VII activity: the effect of monounsaturated fatty acids.,Roche HM; Gibney MJ,"The present study investigated the effect of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) on postprandial coagulation factor VII activity. Fifteen healthy male volunteers consumed three meals containing equal amounts (40 g) of fat, but providing different proportions of MUFA (12, 17 and 24% energy) in random order. Fasting and postprandial blood samples were drawn every hour for 9 h. The magnitude of the postprandial triacylglycerolaemic response and the postprandial plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations were not significantly different following the three meals. Coagulation factor VII was activated during postprandial triacylglycerolaemia but the area under the curve of postprandial coagulation factor VII activity was not significantly different following the three meals. Regression analysis showed that fasting factor VII activity was the single most important factor affecting postprandial factor VII activity, irrespective of plasma lipid concentrations and meal fat composition. Peak postprandial factor VII activity was attained significantly earlier following the high-MUFA meal compared with the low-MUFA meal (6.33 (SD 2.16)h, 3.60 (SD 1.81)h respectively; P = 0.016). Regression analysis showed that meal MUFA content was the primary determinant of time to peak postprandial factor VII activity. Although the magnitude of postprandial coagulation factor VII activity was not affected by meal MUFA content, peak postprandial factor VII activity occurred earlier and fasting activity levels were quickly restored following the high-MUFA meal. A short-lived increase in factor VII activity may be more beneficial than a prolonged thrombotic response.",1997,Apr,Br J Nutr,77,4,537-49,,10.1079/bjn19970055,9155504,#7559,Roche 1997,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Chylomicron particle size and number, factor VII activation and dietary monounsaturated fatty acids.",Silva KD; Kelly CN; Jones AE; Smith RD; Wootton SA; Miller GJ; Williams CM,"This study evaluated the effects of substituting dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) on postprandial chylomicron (triacylglycerol (TAG), apolipoprotein B-48 (apo B-48) and retinyl ester (RE)), chylomicron particle size and factor VII (FVII) response when subjects were given a standard meal. In a controlled sequential design, 51 healthy young subjects followed an SFA-rich diet (Reference diet) for 8 weeks after which half of the subjects followed a moderate MUFA diet (n=25) and half followed a high MUFA diet (n=26) for 16 weeks. Fasting lipoprotein and lipid measurements were evaluated at baseline and at 8-week intervals during the Reference and MUFA diets. In 25 of the subjects (n=12 moderate MUFA, n=13 high MUFA), postprandial responses to a standard test meal containing RE and 13C-tripalmitin were investigated at the end of the Reference and the MUFA diet periods. Although there were no differences in the postprandial lipid markers (TAG, RE, 13C-TAG) on the two diets, the postprandial apo B-48 response (incremental area under the curve (IAUC)) was reduced by 21% on the moderate MUFA diet (NS) and by 54% on the high MUFA diet (P<0.01). The postprandial peak concentrations of apo B-48 were reduced by 33% on the moderate MUFA diet (P<0.01) and 48% on the high MUFA diet (P<0.001). Fasting values for factor VII activity (FVIIc), activated factor VII (FVIIa) or factor VII antigen (FVIIag) did not differ significantly when subjects were transferred from Reference to MUFA diets. However, the postprandial increases in coagulation FVII activity (FVIIc) were 18% lower and of activated FVII (FVIIa) were 17% lower on the moderate MUFA diet (NS). Postprandial increases in FVIIc and FVIIa were 50% (P<0.05) and 29% (P<0.07) lower on the high MUFA diet and the area under the postprandial FVIIc response curve (AUC) was also lower on the high MUFA diet (P<0.05). Significantly higher ratios of RE:apo B-48 (P<0.001) and 13C-palmitic acid:apo B-48 (P<0.01) during both MUFA diets suggest that the CMs formed carry larger amounts of dietary lipids per particle, reflecting an adaptation to form larger lipid droplets in the enterocyte when increased amounts of dietary MUFAs are fed.

Association of Dietary Intakes and Genetically Determined Serum Concentrations of Mono and Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids on Chronic Kidney Disease: Insights from Dietary Analysis and Mendelian Randomization.,Mazidi M; Kengne AP; Siervo M; Kirwan R,"Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake is generally associated with better renal function, while the association of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) remains unconfirmed. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to obtain unconfounded estimates of the causal association of dietary intake and genetically determined serum PUFA and MUFA levels with measures of renal function. Data from participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 2005 to 2010 were used. Data from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on MUFAs, PUFAs, eGFR, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were analysed for the entire sample. A total of 16,025 participants were included. eGFR improved across increasing quartiles of total PUFA intake from 86.3 ± 0.5 (Q1) to 96.2 ± 0.5 mL/min/1.73 m² (Q4), (p < 0.001). Conversely, there was no association between MUFA intake and measures of renal function (all p > 0.21). In multivariable models, the top quartile of PUFA intake had a 21% lower risk for CKD, but there was no significant association between CKD risk and MUFA intake. Genetically determined serum MUFA (heptadecenoate (17:1), myristoleic acid (14:1), and palmitoleic acid (16:1)) and PUFA (α-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) concentrations had no significant association with eGFR and CKD risk. Additionally, no association was found in the analyses stratified by diabetes status.

Effects of lipid-lowering diets enriched with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids on serum lipoprotein composition in patients with hyperlipoproteinaemia.,Gustafsson IB; Vessby B; Nydahl M,"Controlled comparisons of the effects of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as a part of lipid-lowering diets in persons with hyperlipoproteinaemia are sparse. The present study was carried out at a metabolic ward.

Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism modifies fasting total cholesterol concentrations in response to replacement of dietary saturated with monounsaturated fatty acids in adults at moderate cardiovascular disease risk.,Shatwan IM; Weech M; Jackson KG; Lovegrove JA; Vimaleswaran KS,"BACKGROUND: Consumption of ≤10% total energy from fat as saturated fatty acids (SFA) is recommended for cardiovascular disease risk reduction in the UK; however there is no clear guidance on the optimum replacement nutrient. Lipid-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to modify the lipid responses to dietary fat interventions. Hence, we performed a retrospective analysis in 120 participants from the Dietary Intervention and VAScular function (DIVAS) study to investigate whether lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) SNPs modify the fasting lipid response to replacement of SFA with monounsaturated (MUFA) or n-6 polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids. METHODS: The DIVAS study was a randomized, single-blinded, parallel dietary intervention study performed in adults with a moderate cardiovascular risk who received one of three isoenergetic diets rich in SFA, MUFA or n-6 PUFA for 16 weeks. RESULTS: After the 16-week intervention, a significant diet-gene interaction was observed for changes in fasting total cholesterol (P = 0.001). For the APOE SNP rs1064725, only TT homozygotes showed a significant reduction in total cholesterol after the MUFA diet (n = 33; -0.71 ± 1.88 mmol/l) compared to the SFA (n = 38; 0.34 ± 0.55 mmol/l) or n-6 PUFA diets (n = 37; -0.08 ± 0.73 mmol/l) (P = 0.004). None of the interactions were statistically significant for the other SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings have demonstrated a greater sensitivity of the APOE SNP rs1064725 to dietary fat composition, with a total cholesterol lowering effect observed following substitution of SFA with MUFA but not n-6 PUFA.

Adiposity and dietary intake in cardiovascular risk in an obese population from a Mediterranean area.,Garaulet M; Marín C; Pérez-Llamas F; Canterasl M; Tebar FJ; Zamora S,"The aim of the study was to determine the particular relevance of android fat distribution and dietary intake in cardiovascular risk in an obese Mediterranean population with high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and to compare the findings with those from normal-weight subjects. For the study, 193 subjects aged 25-60 were selected: 118 obese (BMI > or = 27 kg/m2), and 75 normal-weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2). Cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were assessed. Nutrient intake and body fat distribution were determined. Results show that MUFA were highly consumed in the total population (21% of total energy). The obese population was normolipidemic and normoinsulinemic. However, cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) were significantly higher than in normal-weight (P < 0.05). Obese subjects derived a greater percentage of their energy intake from total fat and lower from carbohydrates and saturated fats (P < 0.05). BMI and waist-hip ratio positively correlated with fat percentage of total energy intake and with MUFA (g/100 g fatty acids) in men, indicating that the excess of fat intake in obesity is due to a larger consumption of olive oil. CVRF were significantly and positively associated to waist circumference and WHR, both in obese and in normal-weight subjects. In conclusion, not only obesity but also android fat in normal-weight subjects are important factors in cardiovascular disease even in the Mediterranean population, with a high intake of MUFA, where these factors seem to be more relevant to cardiovascular risk than dietary composition.",2004,Mar,J Physiol Biochem,60,1,39-49,,10.1007/BF03168219,15352383,#7685,Garaulet 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Urinary albumin excretion rate and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in NIDDM with microalbuminuria: effects of a monounsaturated-enriched diet.,Nielsen S; Hermansen K; Rasmussen OW; Thomsen C; Mogensen CE,"Previous studies have shown that unsaturated fat-enriched diets may have a beneficial effect on blood pressure in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients, whereas little is known about the effects on albuminuria. In a 3-week cross-over design we compared the effects of a currently recommended high-carbohydrate diet (50% carbohydrate, 30% fat [10% monounsaturated fat]) vs a diet rich in monounsaturated fat (30% carbohydrate, 50% fat [30% monounsaturated fat]) on urinary albumin excretion rate, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure and metabolic control in ten NIDDM patients with persistent microalbuminuria. The 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was similar before and after both the high-carbohydrate diet (mean +/- SD: 145/78 +/- 25/10 vs 143/79 +/- 19/10 mmHg (NS) and the monounsaturated fat diet: 140/78 +/- 16/8 vs 143/79 +/- 15/8 mmHg (NS). No changes were observed in day or night-time blood pressures. Urinary albumin excretion rate was unaffected after 3 weeks' treatment by the diets: from (geometric mean x/divided by tolerance factor) 32.4 x/divided by 2.1 to 36.0 x/divided by 1.9 micrograms/min (NS) vs from 34.2 x/divided by 1.9 to 32.1 x/divided by 2.1 micrograms/min (NS). Fasting plasma glucose, serum fructosamine and HbA1c as well as lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were stable during both diets. Compared to the high-carbohydrate diet a reduction in the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio was observed during the monounsaturated fat diet (p < 0.03). In conclusion, compared to a high-carbohydrate diet, 3 weeks' treatment with a monounsaturated fat diet did not affect the levels of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure or albuminuria in microalbuminuric NIDDM patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,Sep,Diabetologia,38,9,1069-75,,10.1007/BF00402177,8591821,#7705,Nielsen 1995,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of high monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat diets on plasma lipoproteins and lipid peroxidation in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Parfitt VJ; Desomeaux K; Bolton CH; Hartog M,"Increased free radical peroxidation of lipoproteins may contribute to the excess atherosclerosis in Type 2 diabetes mellitus and may be aggravated by increasing polyunsaturate intake. Increasing intake of monounsaturates might have similar hypolipidaemic effects while avoiding this problem. Therefore the effects of high monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat diets on plasma lipoproteins and lipid peroxidation were compared, against each other and a relatively high saturated fat baseline diet, in 13 men with Type 2 diabetes and 12 healthy controls, randomized in crossover fashion to each diet. There were no differences in plasma lipoproteins between the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat diets in the diabetic and control groups separately, but when both groups were combined, high density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher on the monounsaturated fat diet (p = 0.04). Plasma lipid peroxidation was similar on the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat diets in both groups, but all indices of plasma lipid peroxidation in the diabetic group and lipid peroxides in the controls were significantly lower on these diets compared to the baseline diet. Both high monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat diets increase hepatic metabolism of low density lipoprotein and shorten its circulating half-life and both may reduce lipid peroxidation, compared to high saturated fat diets, by this mechanism. On high polyunsaturated fat diets, this effect may offset any increased susceptibility of polyunsaturate enriched low density lipoprotein to peroxidation.",1994,Jan-Feb,Diabet Med,11,1,85-91,,10.1111/j.1464-5491.1994.tb00235.x,8181259,#7769,Parfitt 1994,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
The -514 C/T polymorphism in the hepatic lipase gene promoter is associated with insulin sensitivity in a healthy young population.,Gómez P; Pérez-Jiménez F; Marín C; Moreno JA; Gómez MJ; Bellido C; Pérez-Martínez P; Fuentes F; Paniagua JA; López-Miranda J,"Impaired insulin action has been associated with diabetes, dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic vascular disease. The expression of insulin resistance results from the interaction of environmental and genetic factors. Human hepatic lipase (HL) is a lipolytic enzyme that plays a role in the metabolism of several lipoproteins, while insulin up-regulates the activity of HL via insulin-responsive elements in the HL promoter. We have examined the influence of -514 C/T polymorphism in the hepatic lipase gene promoter on insulin sensitivity in 59 healthy young subjects (30 males and 29 females). The volunteers were subjected to three dietary periods, each lasting four weeks. During the first period all subjects consumed a saturated fat (SFA)-enriched diet with 38% as fat (20% SFA, 12% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and 6% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)). In the second and third dietary periods, a randomized crossover design was used, consisting of a low fat, high carbohydrate diet (CHO diet) (< 10% SFA, 12% MUFA and 6% PUFA) and a high-MUFA, or Mediterranean diet, with < 10% SFA, 22% MUFA and 6% PUFA. We determined the in vivo insulin resistance using the insulin suppression test with somatostatin. Steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentrations (a measure of insulin sensitivity) were significantly higher in men carriers of the -514T allele after the consumption of the SFA diet than after the CHO diet and the Mediterranean diet. This effect was not observed in women. Moreover, there were no significant differences in insulin sensitivity after the three diets in men and women with the CC genotype. In summary, our results show an improvement in insulin sensitivity in men with the -514T allele of the HL promoter polymorphism, when MUFA and carbohydrates are consumed instead of SFA fat.",2005,Apr,J Mol Endocrinol,34,2,331-8,,10.1677/jme.1.01627,15821100,#7777,Gómez 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Effect of Mediterranean and Occidental diets, and red wine, on plasma fatty acids in humans. An intervention study.",Urquiaga I; Guasch V; Marshall G; San Martín A; Castillo O; Rozowski J; Leighton F,"The type of diet consumed by individuals has been associated with the development of some chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, diabetes, and others. Populations that consume diets rich in fruits and vegetables and drink wine in moderation, as the Mediterranean, have a higher life expectancy and less chronic diseases than other occidental populations. We carried out an intervention study in humans to evaluate the effect of a Mediterranean diet (MD), an Occidental diet (OD) and their supplementation with red wine, on biochemical, physiological and clinical parameters related to atherosclerosis and other chronic diseases. For 3 months, two groups of 21 male volunteers each, received either a MD or an OD; during the second month, red wine was added isocalorically, 240 ml/day. At days 0, 30, 60 and 90, clinical, physiological and biochemical evaluations were made. In this article we report on the results obtained in plasma fatty acids profile that includes saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega-6 fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Other results have been published previously. Plasma fatty acid percentages in the OD group, compared to the MD group, did not show differences in SFA, but the OD group showed lower levels of MUFA and omega-3 fatty acids, and higher levels of PUFA and omega-6 fatty acids, with a higher omega-6/omega-3 ratio than the MD group. Wine supplementation reduced MUFA and increased PUFA in both dietary groups, suggesting that wine could improve a diet with a good omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Volunteers on MD showed a better fatty acid profile than those on OD, suggesting a lower cardiovascular risk. Moderate consumption of wine improves this profile in the MD group.",2004,,Biol Res,37,2,253-61,,10.4067/s0716-97602004000200012,15455655,#7791,Urquiaga 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Pretreatment Fasting Plasma Glucose Modifies Dietary Weight Loss Maintenance Success: Results from a Stratified RCT.,Hjorth MF; Due A; Larsen TM; Astrup A,"OBJECTIVE: Levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and fasting insulin (FI) were studied as diet-specific prognostic markers for successful weight loss maintenance in participants with overweight. METHODS: After losing ≥ 8% of body weight, participants received one of three ad libitum diets for 6 months: (1) a moderate-fat diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA); a low-fat, high-fiber diet (Nordic Nutrition Recommendations [NNR]); and the Average Danish Diet (ADD). Participants were categorized as having low (< 90 mg/dL) or high (90-105 mg/dL) FPG based on preintervention values. Median FI among those having high FPG was used as a cutoff for FI (FI ≤ 50 pmol/L; FI > 50 pmol/L). RESULTS: Participants with low FPG and randomized to MUFA, NNR, and ADD regained similarly 2.1 to 2.5 kg after 6 months. By contrast, participants with high FPG and randomized to MUFA, NNR, and ADD regained 2.73 kg (95% CI 1.33 to 4.13; P < 0.001), -0.05 kg (95% CI -1.95 to 1.86; P = 0.96), and 4.16 kg (95% CI 2.27 to 6.06; P < 0.001) after 6 months, respectively, resulting in lower weight regain on NNR compared to ADD (-4.21 kg [95% CI -6.83 to -1.59]; P = 0.002) and MUFA (95% CI -2.77 kg [-5.12 to -0.43]; P = 0.020).

Comparison of monounsaturated fat with carbohydrates as a replacement for saturated fat in subjects with a high metabolic risk profile: studies in the fasting and postprandial states.,Berglund L; Lefevre M; Ginsberg HN; Kris-Etherton PM; Elmer PJ; Stewart PW; Ershow A; Pearson TA; Dennis BH; Roheim PS; Ramakrishnan R; Reed R; Stewart K; Phillips KM,"BACKGROUND: In subjects with a high prevalence of metabolic risk abnormalities, the preferred replacement for saturated fat is unresolved. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study whether carbohydrate or monounsaturated fat is a preferred replacement for saturated fat. DESIGN: Fifty-two men and 33 women, selected to have any combination of HDL cholesterol < or = 30th percentile, triacylglycerol > or = 70th percentile, or insulin > or = 70th percentile, were enrolled in a 3-period, 7-wk randomized crossover study. The subjects consumed an average American diet (AAD; 36% of energy from fat) and 2 additional diets in which 7% of energy from saturated fat was replaced with either carbohydrate (CHO diet) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA diet). RESULTS: Relative to the AAD, LDL cholesterol was lower with both the CHO (-7.0%) and MUFA (-6.3%) diets, whereas the difference in HDL cholesterol was smaller during the MUFA diet (-4.3%) than during the CHO diet (-7.2%). Plasma triacylglycerols tended to be lower with the MUFA diet, but were significantly higher with the CHO diet. Although dietary lipid responses varied on the basis of baseline lipid profiles, the response to diet did not differ between subjects with or without the metabolic syndrome or with or without insulin resistance. Postprandial triacylglycerol concentrations did not differ significantly between the diets. Lipoprotein(a) concentrations increased with both the CHO (20%) and MUFA (11%) diets relative to the AAD.

"Dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, and nutritional correlates in free-living elderly Brazilians: a population-based survey.",Castro MA; Carlos JV; Lopes RC; Januário BL; Marchioni DM; Fisberg RM,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) with nutrient intake and to describe the foods that contribute to dietary GI and GL in elderly subjects. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional population-based survey performed in 2003, which enrolled 804 free-living Brazilian subjects aged 60 years or older. Dietary intake was measured by a single 24-hour dietary recall applied at the subjects' homes. The usual dietary GI and GL as well as the usual energy and nutrient intakes were estimated using external variance components. Dietary GI and GL were categorized in tertiles and the usual mean of nutrient intake was described accordingly. Linear association between dietary GI and GL and nutrient intake was investigated before and after energy adjustment. Foods that contributed with at least 1% of dietary GI and GL were described. RESULTS: Dietary GI was positively associated with starch, total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and inversely associated with total sugar, protein, fiber, and calcium. Dietary GL was strongly and positively associated with total and available carbohydrates, starch, and total sugar and inversely associated with protein, total fat, MUFA, PUFA, and cholesterol. White breads and white rice were the major contributors to dietary GI and GL in the studied population. CONCLUSION: Dietary GI and GL are important indicators of overall quality and quantity of carbohydrates from elderly Brazilians diet and are also associated with other macronutrients such as protein, fat, and fiber.

Composition of Dietary Fatty Acids and Health Risks in Japanese Youths.,Okuda M; Fujiwara A; Sasaki S,"In the overall composition of dietary fatty acids (FAs), the quantity of each FA is interrelated with that of others. We examined the associations between dietary FA composition and cardiometabolic risk in Japanese youths. Risk factors (anthropometric characteristics, serum lipid and liver enzyme levels, and blood pressure) were measured in 5485 junior-high-school students. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. The mean saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), and omega-3 PUFAs intake were 9.6%E, 10.3%E, 6.3%E, and 1.1%E, respectively. In compositional regression analysis controlled for confounders, a high intake of omega-6 PUFAs relative to others was associated with low low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-C; p = 0.003), and relative SFA intake was associated with high levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (p = 0.019). Relative omega-3 PUFAs intake was associated with low blood pressure (p = 0.005-0.034) but had unfavorable effects on adiposity and alanine transaminase. Substitutional models showed similar results for omega-6 PUFAs on LDL-C, but MUFA had inconsistent effects on risk factors. The results from the compositional data analysis were consistent with previous studies and clinical practice/knowledge.

Acute effects of meal fatty acid composition on insulin sensitivity in healthy post-menopausal women.,Robertson MD; Jackson KG; Fielding BA; Williams CM; Frayn KN,"Postprandial plasma insulin concentrations after a single high-fat meal may be modified by the presence of specific fatty acids although the effects of sequential meal ingestion are unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of altering the fatty acid composition in a single mixed fat-carbohydrate meal on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity of a second meal eaten 5 h later. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a minimal model approach. Ten healthy post-menopausal women underwent four two-meal studies in random order. A high-fat breakfast (40 g fat) where the fatty acid composition was predominantly saturated fatty acids (SFA), n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), long-chain n-3 PUFA or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was followed 5 h later by a low-fat, high-carbohydrate lunch (5.7 g fat), which was identical in all four studies. The plasma insulin response was significantly higher following the SFA meal than the other meals after both breakfast and lunch (P<0.006) although there was no effect of breakfast fatty acid composition on plasma glucose concentrations. Postprandial insulin sensitivity (SI(Oral)) was assessed for 180 min after each meal. SI(Oral) was significantly lower after lunch than after breakfast for all four test meals (P=0.019) following the same rank order (SFA < n-6 PUFA < n-3 PUFA < MUFA) for each meal.

Comparison of the effects of a monounsaturated fat diet and a high carbohydrate diet on cardiovascular risk factors in first degree relatives to type-2 diabetic subjects.,Thomsen C; Rasmussen O; Christiansen C; Pedersen E; Vesterlund M; Storm H; Ingerslev J; Hermansen K,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated beneficial metabolic effects of dietary monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in Type-2 diabetes mellitus (Type-2 DM). The question arises if dietary MUFA also has desirable effects on risk markers in subjects with high risk of developing Type-2 DM. SETTING: University department of endocrinology. SUBJECTS: Sixteen healthy, first-degree relatives (six men, 10 women, age (mean+/-s.d.): 35+/-2 years) with normal oral glucose tolerance tests. INTERVENTIONS: Randomised study with two 4-week treatment periods with either a carbohydrate-rich (CHO) diet (55 E% carbohydrate, 30 E% fat, 15 E% protein) or a diet rich in olive oil [MUFA 40 E% fat (25 E% as MUFA), 45 E% carbohydrate, 15 E% protein]. The periods were divided by a 4-week wash-out period. RESULTS: Similar lowering effects on total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride and apoB levels were seen after the two diets. Slightly higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (1.4+/-0.4 vs 1.3+/-0.4 mmol/l, P<0. 0001) and apoA-1 (1.2+/-0.3 vs 1.1+/-0.3 mmol/l, P<0.05) were found in the MUFA-diet. Furthermore, the insulin sensitivity, as assessed by Bergman's minimal model, and the first response insulin areas were similar, as were the 24-h blood pressures and the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Isocaloric diets rich in MUFA or rich in carbohydrate, respectively, seem to have similar effects on cardiovascular risk factors in persons at high risk of developing Type-2 DM. A potential risk, however, on body weight of high-fat diets should be kept in mind.

How fatty acids affect postprandial insulin, glucose, and triglyceride concentrations, however, remains unclear. The objective of this study was to study the effect of fatty acids on postprandial insulin, glucose, and triglyceride responses. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Test meals rich in palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and containing 1,000 kcal each were administered in a randomized crossover design to 11 type 2 diabetic subjects. Serum insulin, glucose, and triglyceride concentrations were measured for 360 min. All subjects received an isoenergetic diet of constant composition throughout the study. RESULTS: According to repeated-measures ANOVA, the insulin (P = 0.0002) but not glucose (P = 0.10) response was significantly different between meals. The insulin response was lower to meals rich in oleic acid or EPA and DHA than to meals rich in palmitic acid or linoleic acid (P < 0.01). The triglyceride response did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06) but tended to be lower with EPA and DHA than with the other fatty acids. Similar trends were seen for area under the curve (AUC) and incremental AUC for serum insulin and triglycerides, but the differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with palmitic acid and linoleic acid, oleic acid or EPA and DHA may modestly lower insulin response in patients with type 2 diabetes without deteriorating the glucose response.

"Effects of diets enriched in lauric, palmitic or oleic acids on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.",Temme EH; Mensink RP; Hornstra G,"In this study we compared the effects of specific saturated fatty acids (lauric acid and palmitic acid) with those of a monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) on coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters in healthy women and men. Eighteen women and fourteen men consumed, in random order, three experimental diets, each for six weeks. The diets consisted of solid foods and approximately 70% [28 percent of energy (En%)] of the fat calories was supplied.

The lauric acid diet also contained some (average 1.8 En%) more myristic acid. Compared with the oleic acid diet, factor VIIam in the female subjects was 9% higher with the lauric acid diet (P = 0.0036; 95% CI, 3 to 14%) and 10% higher with the palmitic acid diet (P = 0.0011; 95% CI, 5 to 16%).

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI-1) activity was higher on the palmitic acid compared with the oleic acid diet (difference between diets of 2.3 U/ml; P = 0.0098; 95% CI, 0.4 to 4.3 U/ml) and the lauric acid diet (difference between diets of 2.2 U/ml; P = 0.0123; 95% CI, 0.2 to 4.1 U/ml). No significant differences between diets were observed for antithrombin III activity, fibrinogen concentrations, fragment 1+2 concentrations, plasminogen or alpha2-antiplasmin activity. From this study, we conclude that diets rich in lauric or palmitic acid, compared with a diet rich in oleic acid, unfavourably influence factor VIIam activity, in a gender specific manner. In addition, the plasminogen activator inhibiting capacity of the plasma is impaired with a palmitic acid rich diet compared with an oleic or lauric acid rich diet.",1999,Feb,Thromb Haemost,81,2,259-63,,,10064003,#7902,Temme 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary (n-3) fatty acids reduce plasma F2-isoprostanes but not prostaglandin F2alpha in healthy humans.,Nälsén C; Vessby B; Berglund L; Uusitupa M; Hermansen K; Riccardi G; Rivellese A; Storlien L; Erkkilä A; Ylä-Herttuala S; Tapsell L; Basu S,"(n-3) Fatty acids are unsaturated and are therefore easily subject to oxidization; however, they have several beneficial health effects, which include protection against cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether (n-3) fatty acids, with a controlled fat quality in the background diet, affect nonenzymatic and enzymatic lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in humans. A total of 162 men and women in a multicenter study (The KANWU study) were randomly assigned to a diet containing a high proportion of saturated fatty acids or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) for 3 mo. Within each diet group, there was a second random assignment to supplementation with fish-oil capsules [3.6 g (n-3) fatty acids/d] or placebo. Biomarkers of nonenzymatic and enzymatic lipid peroxidation in vivo were determined by measuring 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (8-iso-PGF(2alpha)) and prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) concentrations in plasma at baseline and after 3 mo. Antioxidant status was determined by measuring plasma antioxidant capacity with an enhanced chemiluminescence assay. The plasma 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) concentration was significantly decreased after 3 mo of supplementation with (n-3) fatty acids (P = 0.015), whereas the PGF(2alpha) concentration was not affected. The antioxidant status was not affected by supplementation of (n-3) fatty acids, but was improved by the background diet with a high proportion of MUFA. We conclude that supplementation with (n-3) fatty acids decreases nonenzymatic free radical-catalyzed isoprostane formation, but does not affect cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin formation.",2006,May,J Nutr,136,5,1222-8,,10.1093/jn/136.5.1222,16614408,#7905,Nälsén 2006,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Comparison of 3 ad libitum diets for weight-loss maintenance, risk of cardiovascular disease, and diabetes: a 6-mo randomized, controlled trial.",Due A; Larsen TM; Mu H; Hermansen K; Stender S; Astrup A,"BACKGROUND: The optimal dietary content and type of fat and carbohydrate for weight management has been debated for decades. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the effects of 3 ad libitum diets on the maintenance of an initial weight loss of >or=8% and risk factors for CVD and diabetes during a 6-mo controlled dietary intervention. DESIGN: Nondiabetic overweight or obese [mean +/- SD body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 31.5 +/- 2.6] men (n = 55) and women (n = 76) aged 28.2 +/- 4.8 y were randomly assigned to a diet providing a moderate amount of fat (35-45% of energy) and >20% of fat as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA diet; n = 54), to a low-fat (20-30% of energy) diet (LF diet; n = 51), or to a control diet (35% of energy as fat; n = 26). Protein constituted 10-20% of energy in all 3 diets. All foods were provided free of charge from a purpose-built supermarket. RESULTS: More subjects dropped out of the MUFA (28%) group than out of the LF group (16%) and control group (8%) (MUFA compared with control: P < 0.05). All groups regained weight (MUFA: 2.5 +/- 0.7 kg; LF: 2.2 +/- 0.7 kg; and control: 3.8 +/- 0.8 kg; NS). Body fat regain was lower in the LF (0.6 +/- 0.6%) and MUFA (1.6 +/- 0.6%) groups than in the control group (2.6 +/- 0.5%) (P < 0.05). In the MUFA group, fasting insulin decreased by 2.6 +/- 3.5 pmol/L, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance by 0.17 +/- 0.13, and the ratio of LDL to HDL by 0.33 +/- 0.13; in the LF group, these variables increased by 4.3 +/- 3.0 pmol/L (P < 0.08) and 0.17 +/- 0.10 (P < 0.05) and decreased by 0.02 +/- 0.09 (P = 0.005), respectively; and in the control group, increased by 14.0 +/- 4.3 pmol/L (P < 0.001), 0.57 +/- 0.17 (P < 0.001), and 0.05 +/- 0.14 (P = 0.036), respectively. Dietary adherence was high on the basis of fatty acid changes in adipose tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Diet composition had no major effect on preventing weight regain. However, both the LF and MUFA diets produced less body fat regain than did the control diet, and the dropout rate was lowest in the LF diet group, whereas fasting insulin decreased and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and ratio of LDL to HDL improved with the MUFA diet.

"Dietary Habits, Fatty Acids and Carotenoid Levels Are Associated with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Chinese.",Ng AL; Leung HH; Kawasaki R; Ho WL; Chow LL; Chow SS; Lee JC; Wong IY,"The role of diet and circulatory carotenoids and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) but not well studied in Chinese. However, other fatty acids were not comprehensively evaluated if it had additional consequence on AMD. This study investigated the relationship among dietary habits, fatty acids levels, carotenoids and AMD in Hong Kong Chinese adults. In this cross-sectional case-controlled study, plasma fatty acids including, saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and carotenoids levels were quantified between patients with neovascular AMD (n = 99) and age-gender-matched controls (n = 198). A food frequency questionnaire was also conducted. Low blood carotenoid levels and omega-3 PUFAs namely DHA, EPA and -linolenic acid increased the odds ratio of developing neovascular AMD. High blood omega-6 PUFAs specifically arachidonic acid and eicosadienoic acid, oleic acid (a MUFA) and SFA levels increased the odds ratio of having neovascular AMD. Neovascular AMD group had significantly less omega-3 PUFA rich food (vegetables, nuts, seafood) intake and higher SFA (meat) intake than controls. In short, neovascular AMD was associated with lower circulatory levels of carotenoids and omega-3 PUFAs, and higher level of omega-6 PUFAs, oleic acid and SFAs in the Hong Kong Chinese population. These findings enhance the understandings of dietary impacts on neovascular AMD and provide a context for future nutritional intervention studies.",2019,Jul,Nutrients,11,8,,,10.3390/nu11081720,31349710,#7920,Ng 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Reduction of De Novo Lipogenesis Mediates Beneficial Effects of Isoenergetic Diets on Fatty Liver: Mechanistic Insights from the MEDEA Randomized Clinical Trial.,Costabile G; Della Pepa G; Salamone D; Luongo D; Naviglio D; Brancato V; Cavaliere C; Salvatore M; Cipriano P; Vitale M; Corrado A; Rivellese AA; Annuzzi G; Bozzetto L,"BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic liver steatosis (NAS) results from an imbalance between hepatic lipid storage, disposal, and partitioning. A multifactorial diet high in fiber, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), polyphenols, and vitamins D, E, and C reduces NAS in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) by 40% compared to a MUFA-rich diet. We evaluated whether dietary effects on NAS are mediated by changes in hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) activity, and/or β-oxidation. METHODS: According to a randomized parallel group study design, 37 individuals with T2D completed an 8-week isocaloric intervention with a MUFA diet (n = 20) or multifactorial diet (n = 17). Before and after the intervention, liver fat content was evaluated by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, serum triglyceride fatty acid concentrations measured by gas chromatography, plasma β-hydroxybutyrate by enzymatic method, and DNL and SCD-1 activity assessed by calculating the palmitic acid/linoleic acid (C16:0/C18:2 n6) and palmitoleic acid/palmitic acid (C16:1/C16:0) ratios, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, mean ± SD DNL significantly decreased after the multifactorial diet (2.2 ± 0.8 vs. 1.5 ± 0.5, p = 0.0001) but did not change after the MUFA diet (1.9 ± 1.1 vs. 1.9 ± 0.9, p = 0.949), with a significant difference between the two interventions (p = 0.004). The mean SCD-1 activity also decreased after the multifactorial diet (0.13 ± 0.05 vs. 0.10 ± 0.03; p = 0.001), but with no significant difference between interventions (p = 0.205). Fasting plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations did not change significantly after the MUFA or multifactorial diet. Changes in the DNL index significantly and positively correlated with changes in liver fat (r = 0.426; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: A diet rich in multiple beneficial dietary components (fiber, polyphenols, MUFAs, PUFAs, and other antioxidants) compared to a diet rich only in MUFAs further reduces liver fat accumulation through the inhibition of DNL.

"Adverse profile of dietary nutrients, anthropometry and lipids in urban slum dwellers of northern India.",Misra A; Sharma R; Pandey RM; Khanna N,"OBJECTIVES: The intra-country rural to urban migrant populations undergo radical socio-economic and lifestyle changes in a developing country. Therefore, it is an interesting sample in which to study nutrition pattern, anthropometry and metabolic profile. The aim of this study was to assess nutrient profile and its association with the anthropometry, percentage body fat (%BF) and blood lipids in the urban slum dwellers in northern India. DESIGN: A cross sectional epidemiological descriptive study. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in urban slum colony of Gautam Nagar, situated in a southern area of New Delhi. SUBJECTS: The data was recorded in 227 subjects (52 males and 175 females). RESULTS: The diets averaged approximately 59-60% of energy from carbohydrates, 12-13% energy from protein, and 24-27% energy from dietary total fat. Lower intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), a low ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids, a high ratio of polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids, a high intake of erucic acid, and a low consumption of fibre and vitamin E intake were significant observations. Although their mean body mass index (BMI) was in a low range (20.5+/-4.2), %BF was high in females (26.7+/-8.6%; P=0.001), and a high prevalence of abdominal obesity was observed in both males (22%) and females (16%). Moreover, there was high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and, in particular, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Those consuming a high-fat diet (>30%) also consumed high MUFA, n-3 fatty acids, saturated fat and dietary cholesterol. Carbohydrate intake as percentage energy was a significant predictor of the levels of triacylglycerol in males, while in females significant predictors for triacylglycerol include intake of carbohydrate as percentage energy, age, %BF and BMI. CONCLUSION: In this economically deprived population, now constituting approximately 30-50% of the urban population of major cities in India, such adverse dietary, anthropometric and metabolic factors are predictors of early and accelerated atherosclerosis.

An increase in dietary n-3 fatty acids decreases a marker of bone resorption in humans.,Griel AE; Kris-Etherton PM; Hilpert KF; Zhao G; West SG; Corwin RL,"Human, animal, and in vitro research indicates a beneficial effect of appropriate amounts of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on bone health. This is the first controlled feeding study in humans to evaluate the effect of dietary plant-derived n-3 PUFA on bone turnover, assessed by serum concentrations of N-telopeptides (NTx) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP). Subjects (n = 23) consumed each diet for 6 weeks in a randomized, 3-period crossover design: 1) Average American Diet (AAD; [34% total fat, 13% saturated fatty acids (SFA), 13% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), 9% PUFA (7.7% LA, 0.8% ALA)]), 2) Linoleic Acid Diet (LA; [37% total fat, 9% SFA, 12% MUFA, 16% PUFA (12.6% LA, 3.6% ALA)]), and 3) alpha-Linolenic Acid Diet (ALA; [38% total fat, 8% SFA, 12% MUFA, 17% PUFA (10.5% LA, 6.5% ALA)]). Walnuts and flaxseed oil were the predominant sources of ALA. NTx levels were significantly lower following the ALA diet (13.20 +/- 1.21 nM BCE), relative to the AAD (15.59 +/- 1.21 nM BCE) (p < 0.05). Mean NTx level following the LA diet was 13.80 +/- 1.21 nM BCE. There was no change in levels of BSAP across the three diets. Concentrations of NTx were positively correlated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha for all three diets. The results indicate that plant sources of dietary n-3 PUFA may have a protective effect on bone metabolism via a decrease in bone resorption in the presence of consistent levels of bone formation.",2007,Jan,Nutr J,6,,2,,10.1186/1475-2891-6-2,17227589,#7967,Griel 2007,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Effect of high carbohydrate intake on hyperglycemia, islet function, and plasma lipoproteins in NIDDM.",Garg A; Grundy SM; Koffler M,"OBJECTIVE: To study effects of high carbohydrate intake on hyperglycemia, islet functions, and plasma lipoproteins in patients with NIDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An attempt was made to induce hyperglycemia in 10 men with NIDDM by feeding them an isocaloric high-carbohydrate diet (65% of energy as simple carbohydrates [31% as glucose] and 20% as fat) for 28 days in a metabolic ward. Response to the high-carbohydrate diet was compared with that of feeding a diet rich in monounsaturated fat (45% of energy as fat [31% as monounsaturated fat] and 38% as carbohydrates) for 28 days in a cross-over manner. Islet functions were assessed by evaluating plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon responses to standard meal tolerance tests on days 0, 14, 21, and 28 of each dietary period. Fasting plasma lipoproteins were determined during the last week of each dietary period. RESULTS: The high-carbohydrate diet caused significant but modest accentuation of hyperglycemia, particularly in patients with moderately severe diabetes mellitus, whereas no change was observed with the high-monounsaturated fatty-acid diet. Accentuation of hyperglycemia was accompanied by an increase in plasma glucagon levels, but no significant change in insulin and C-peptide responses. In 1 patient, feeding the high-carbohydrate diet for 68 days produced marked hyperglycemia and caused definite suppression of insulin and C-peptide responses along with an increase in glucagon levels. Compared with the high-monounsaturated fat diet, the high-carbohydrate diet also raised plasma triglyceride and VLDL cholesterol concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: High-carbohydrate diets may cause accentuation of hyperglycemia and a rise in plasma glucagon levels in NIDDM patients. High-carbohydrate diets also adversely affect lipoproteins and therefore may not be desirable in all NIDDM patients.",1992,Nov,Diabetes Care,15,11,1572-80,,10.2337/diacare.15.11.1572,1468287,#8029,Garg 1992,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

DESIGN: Forty-six nondiabetic, obese [mean (+/-SEM) body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 31.2 +/- 0.3] men (n = 20) and premenopausal women (n = 26) aged 28.0 +/- 0.7 y were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 diets after > or = 8% weight loss: 1) MUFA diet (n = 16): moderate in fat (35-45% of energy) and high in monounsaturated fatty acids ( > 20% of energy); 2) LF diet (n = 18): low-fat diet (20-30% of energy), and 3) control diet (n = 12): 35% of energy as fat ( > 15% of energy as saturated fatty acids). Protein accounted for 15% of energy in all 3 diets. A 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) was performed before and after the 6-mo dietary intervention. All foods were provided by a purpose-built supermarket. RESULTS: After 6 mo, the MUFA diet reduced fasting glucose (-3.0%), insulin (-9.4%), and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score (-12.1%). Compared with the MUFA diet, the control diet increased these variables [1.4% (P = 0.014), 21.2% (P = 0.030), and 22.8% (P = 0.015), respectively], as did the LF diet [1.4% (P = 0.090), 13.1% (P = 0.078), and 15.5% (P = 0.095), respectively].

Association of dietary fat intake and hepatocellular carcinoma among US adults.,Moussa I; Day RS; Li R; Kaseb A; Jalal PK; Daniel-MacDougall C; Hatia RI; Abdelhakeem A; Rashid A; Chun YS; Li D; Hassan MM,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The role of dietary fat consumption in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. We investigated the associations of total fat and fatty acids with risk of HCC among US adults in a hospital-based case-control study. METHODS: We analyzed data from 641 cases and 1034 controls recruited at MD Anderson Cancer Center during 2001-2018. Cases were new patients with a pathologically or radiologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC; controls were cancer-free spouses of patients with cancers other than gastrointestinal, lung, liver, or head and neck. Cases and controls were frequency-matched by age and sex. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for major HCC risk factors, including hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection. RESULTS: Monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake was inversely associated with HCC risk (highest vs. lowest tertile: OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33-0.72). Total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake was directly associated with HCC risk (highest vs. lowest tertile: OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.23-2.70). Omega-6 PUFA was directly associated with HCC risk (highest vs. lowest tertile: OR 2.29; 95% CI, 1.52-3.44).

Intake of nutrients associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in a Spanish population.,Capita R; Alonso-Calleja C,"The daily intake of nutrients associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease was assessed in Spain to provide current data on adequance to the Spanish nutritional objectives and recommendations. The energy and nutrient distribution throughout the day was also determined. Nutrient intake data of 100 people (24 males and 76 females) aged 20-40 years living in Ponferrada (León, northwest Spain) were calculated from seven non-consecutive daily dietary records using Spanish food composition tables. The survey was carried out in the autumn of 2001. The average energy (E) intake was 2906.67 kcal (12.16 MJ)/day among men and 2106.95 kcal (8.82 MJ)/day among women, with total fat accounting for 39.21 E% (men) and 38.96 E% (women). Average saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were 13.03, 15.51 and 6.22 E% (men), and 12.20, 15.58 and 7.10 E% (women). The SFA:MUFA:PUFA ratios were 2.1:2.5:1.0 (men) and 1.7:2.2:1.0 (women), with adequate essential fatty acids (FA) amounts. PUFA n-3 FA daily intake (2.46 g and 1.68 g for men and women, respectively) was adjusted to the recommended levels, with a n-6/n-3 ratio of 7.14 (men) and 8.33 (women). Low trans-FA levels were reported both among male (3.10 g/day) and female (2.21 g/day) populations. High daily cholesterol intakes were found (440.87 mg for men and 359.14 mg for women). Average daily intakes of dietary fibre, alcohol, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E, selenium and sodium were 20.14 and 15.68 g, 7.00 and 4.11 g, 736.00 and 739.28 retinol equivalents, 103.45 and 95.24 mg, 8.73 and 7.84 mg, 83.26 and 45.93 micrograms, and 3777.21 and 2488.12 mg for men and women, respectively.

The study community diet was monotonous and made for possible deficiencies of iron, magnesium, zinc, vitamin B(6) and vitamin D, in variable proportions. Routine biochemical and haematological normality markers indicate that only one woman presented hyperglycaemia and hyperuricaemia. Two women had haemoglobin levels <12 g/dl, but their mean corpuscular volume or mean corpuscular haemoglobin was normal. The prevalence of high cholesterol values (>6.21 mmol/l) was 42.8%, while that of high LDL-cholesterol levels (>3.88 mmol/l) was 35.7%, but none of the women displayed levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol <1.16 mmol/l, triglycerides >1.2 mmol/l or an LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio>3. Only one woman had apolipoprotein (Apo) B levels >1.5 g/l, while most of the women presented Apo B values <1.2 g/l and an ApoA-1/ApoB ratio &<1.1. Plasma and LDL-peroxide levels, together with the tocopherol and carotene intakes, suggest a good antioxidant status in this population. CONCLUSIONS: The diet of the study group seems compatible with a healthy life-profile and permits a more-than-acceptable degree of cardiovascular disease protection. However, the consumption of certain nutrients should be improved.",2003,Sep,Eur J Clin Nutr,57 Suppl 1,,S26-30,,10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601806,12947448,#8107,Sánchez-Muniz 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Lipoprotein composition in NIDDM: effects of dietary oleic acid on the composition, oxidisability and function of low and high density lipoproteins.",Dimitriadis E; Griffin M; Collins P; Johnson A; Owens D; Tomkin GH,"Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is related to the fatty acid composition which is altered in diabetes mellitus. This study examines the relationship between the fatty acid composition of LDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL) and lipoprotein oxidation. A group of nine non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients were compared to seven healthy control subjects before and after a high monounsaturated diet. Lipoproteins were isolated and oxidisability was measured by conjugated diene formation and lipid peroxide analysis. Serum HDL cholesterol was significantly lower in the diabetic patients. LDL cholesteryl ester linoleic acid in the diabetic patients was significantly higher at baseline and decreased after diet (p < 0.05) while oleic acid increased in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects (p < 0.05). HDL cholesteryl ester oleic acid was lower in the diabetic patients compared with control subjects (p < 0.05) before diet and it increased significantly after diet (p < 0.05). LDL lipid peroxides and conjugated diene formation were related to LDL glycation (r = 0.46, p < 0.05 and r = 0.49, p < 0.05, respectively). Both decreased following diet (lipid peroxides for diabetic patients from 476 +/- 30 to 390 +/- 20 nmol/mg protein p < 0.05 and for control subjects from 350 +/- 36 to 198 +/- 30 nmol/mg protein p < 0.05). HDL conjugated diene formation decreased in both groups after diet but only significantly in the control group (55.4 +/- 7.5 to 53.2 +/- 6.7 nmol/mg protein for diabetic patients and 45.8 +/- 6.4 to 31.6 +/- 4.8 nmol/mg protein p < 0.05 for control subjects). There was a positive correlation between LDL lipid peroxide formation and percentage of cholesteryl ester linoleic acid in LDL from diabetic patients (r = 0.61, p < 0.05) and control subjects (r = 0.91, p < 0.01). Fatty acid composition of LDL was reflected in the composition of HDL. In the presence of HDL lipoprotein peroxidation decreased. This decrease in lipoprotein peroxidation was positively related to the percentage of linoleic acid in LDL (r = 0.71, p < 0.05). This study confirms the close relationship between the fatty acid composition of LDL and HDL and demonstrates the importance of the fatty acid composition of the cholesteryl ester fraction in relation to LDL oxidation in diabetes. Linoleic acid in HDL appears to be a protecting factor against oxidation.",1996,Jun,Diabetologia,39,6,667-76,,10.1007/BF00418538,8781762,#8117,Dimitriadis 1996,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Fat-modified diets during pregnancy and lactation and serum lipids after birth.,Fard NM; Mehrabian F; Sarraf-Zadegan N; Sajadi F,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the influence of modifying the maternal dietary fat on the serum lipids of infants at birth and at one year of age. METHODS: This single-blind randomized clinical trial was done on 180 4-month-pregnant women. All subjects proved to have a fat-unmodified diet through a 4-day food record dietary questionnaire. They were divided randomly into two groups. The intervention group was kept on a fat-modified diet including saturated fatty acid (SFA) < 10%, monounsaturated fatty acids: (MUFA) 10-5%, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) upto 10% and cholesterol < 300 mg/day with dietary advice for the pregnancy period. The control group was given only the latter advice. All subjects were followed up monthly. The serum lipids including total cholesterol (T.cho), triglyceride (TG), and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) were analyzed through enzymatic methods. The level of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated by Friedewald formula. The comparison of mean cord and one-year-old infant serum lipids were done through unpaired T-test in two groups. RESULTS: The mean level of T.cho in the intervention and control group was (70.3+/-15.9, vs 81.4+/-17.2, P< 0.009), TG (85.3 +/- 16.7 vs 97.5 +/- 18.2, P< 0.007), LDL-C (27.8 +/- 15.2 vs 34.8 +/- 17.1, P< 0.04) and non-HDL-C (44.5+/-7.2 vs 54.5 +/- 8.1, P< 0.02) and in one year old infant the comparison of serum lipids were as follows. T.cho (145.7 +/- 51.4 vs 161.4 +/- 56.2, P< 0.003), TG (90.1 +/- 31.8 vs 98.3 +/- 33.1, P< 0.02), LDL-C (85.6 +/- 20.4 vs 92.3 +/- 19.6, P< 0,05) and non-HDL-C (113.6 +/- 30.2 vs 128.8 +/- 34.8, P< 0.04). However, there was no significant difference in HDL-C of both groups. CONCLUSION: There is a significant decrease of T.cho, TG, LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels with no significant increase of HDL-C in the intervention group with the fat-modified diet. Maternal fat-modified diet could be suitable way to prevent cardiovascular disease among infants from the beginning of the life.",2004,Aug,Indian J Pediatr,71,8,683-7,,10.1007/BF02730653,15345867,#8118,Fard 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Effects of a healthy Nordic diet on plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in subjects with metabolic syndrome: a randomized, [corrected] controlled trial (SYSDIET).",Brader L; Rejnmark L; Carlberg C; Schwab U; Kolehmainen M; Rosqvist F; Cloetens L; Landin-Olsson M; Gunnarsdottir I; Poutanen KS; Herzig KH; Risérus U; Savolainen MJ; Thorsdottir I; Uusitupa M; Hermansen K,"PURPOSE: At northern latitudes, vitamin D is not synthesized endogenously during winter, causing low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of a healthy Nordic diet based on Nordic nutrition recommendations (NNR) on plasma 25(OH)D and explored its dietary predictors. METHODS: In a Nordic multi-centre trial, subjects (n = 213) with metabolic syndrome were randomized to a control or a healthy Nordic diet favouring fish (≥300 g/week, including ≥200 g/week fatty fish), whole-grain products, berries, fruits, vegetables, rapeseed oil and low-fat dairy products. Plasma 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone were analysed before and after 18- to 24-week intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, 45 % had vitamin D inadequacy (<50 nmol/l), whereas 8 % had deficiency (<25 nmol/l). Dietary vitamin D intake was increased by the healthy Nordic diet (P < 0.001). The healthy Nordic and the control diet reduced the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy by 42 % (P < 0.001) and 19 % (P = 0.002), respectively, without between-group difference (P = 0.142). Compared with control, plasma 25(OH)D (P = 0.208) and parathyroid hormone (P = 0.207) were not altered by the healthy Nordic diet. Predictors for 25(OH)D were intake of vitamin D, eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA), docosahexaenoic acids (DHA), vitamin D supplement, plasma EPA and plasma DHA. Nevertheless, only vitamin D intake and season predicted the 25(OH)D changes. CONCLUSION: Consuming a healthy Nordic diet based on NNR increased vitamin D intake but not plasma 25(OH)D concentration. The reason why fish consumption did not improve vitamin D status might be that many fish are farmed and might contain little vitamin D or that frying fish may result in vitamin D extraction. Additional ways to improve vitamin D status in Nordic countries may be needed.",2014,Jun,Eur J Nutr,53,4,1123-34,,10.1007/s00394-014-0674-3,24570029,#8183,Brader 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Modification in a single meal is sufficient to provoke benefits in inflammatory responses of individuals at low-to-moderate cardiometabolic risk.,Monfort-Pires M; Ferreira SRG,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Postprandial state is characterized by metabolic changes which may elevate circulating inflammatory biomarkers, used to assess cardiometabolic risk. It is unclear if biological benefits of certain food components could be obtained by a short-term change in a single meal of Brazilian's habitual diet. We investigated the postprandial effects of 2 fat tolerance tests (FTT) with different isocaloric meals (a typical Brazilian and a modified meal) differing by type of fatty acids and fiber contents, prior to and after breakfast interventions. METHODS: This crossover clinical trial included 80 overweight individuals with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor, (35-69 years) who received two isocaloric breakfast interventions for 4 weeks, with a 2-week washout. The Brazilian breakfast was saturated fat-enriched while the modified one was rich in unsaturated fatty acids and fibers. Before and after intervention periods, individuals underwent two FTT with meals with similar composition to the interventions breakfasts but higher energy content. Variables were compared by repeated-measures ANOVA. Correlations were assessed by Pearson's coefficient. RESULTS: At the end of both interventions, participants did not change plasma glucose or triglycerides. The higher IL-6 and IL-8 responses to the FTT with the Brazilian meal compared to that with the modified meal was accentuated after the interventions (p-diet <0.01; p-time <0.01). Acutely, E-selectin, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10 and IL-17 concentrations did not increase in response to the FTTs, but showed higher values only after the Brazilian intervention. In contrast, intervention with the modified breakfast induced reductions in fasting and postprandial cytokines (p-diet <0.01). Changes in MUFA and PUFA intakes were inversely correlated to changes in inflammatory markers, while changes in saturated fat intake were directly correlated to IFN-γ and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Isocaloric meals with distinct nutrient composition elicit different postprandial inflammatory responses after a relatively short intervention in a single meal. Each saturated fat-enriched meal consumed, as well as each unsaturated fat and fiber-enriched meal may induce pro- or anti-inflammatory responses that could impact on the cardiometabolic risk profile.",2016,Dec,Clin Nutr,35,6,1242-1250,ReBec/RBR-98x6b5,10.1016/j.clnu.2016.02.015,26987426,#8194,Monfort-Pires 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Saturated fat intake and prostate cancer aggressiveness: results from the population-based North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project.,Allott EH; Arab L; Su LJ; Farnan L; Fontham ET; Mohler JL; Bensen JT; Steck SE,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence supports a role for cholesterol in prostate cancer (PC). Dietary saturated fat content impacts serum cholesterol levels. However, epidemiologic associations between saturated fat and PC aggressiveness are inconsistent. We hypothesized that high saturated fat intake would be associated with increased PC aggressiveness, and that statin use would modify this association. METHODS: Of 1854 PC cases in the North Carolina-Louisiana PC Project, 321 (17%) were classified as high aggressive (Gleason sum ⩾8, PSA>20 ng ml(-1), or Gleason sum ⩾7 and clinical stage T3-4) or low/intermediate aggressive (all other cases). Using low/intermediate aggressive cases as the referent group, we examined the association between tertiles of total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake and high aggressive PC using logistic regression, overall and stratified by race and statin use. We examined total fat-adjusted polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA and MUFA, respectively), trans fat and cholesterol intake in secondary analysis. RESULTS: High total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake was associated with an elevated odds ratio (OR) for aggressive PC (OR(T3vsT1) 1.51; 95% CI 1.10-2.06; P-trend=0.009), with an attenuated association in statin users (OR(T3vsT1) 1.16; 95% CI 0.67-2.01; P-trend=0.661) compared with non-users (OR(T3vsT1) 1.71; 95% CI 1.16-2.51; P-trend=0.053). High total fat-adjusted cholesterol intake was associated with aggressive PC in European Americans (OR(T3vsT1) 1.62; 95% CI 1.02-2.58; P-trend=0.056), but not African Americans (OR(T3vsT1) 0.92; 95% CI 0.60-1.42; P-trend=0.750). High total fat-adjusted PUFA was inversely associated with PC aggressiveness (OR(T3vsT1) 0.75; 95% CI 0.55-1.03), although this was not significant. No associations were found between total fat-adjusted MUFA or trans fat and PC aggressiveness. CONCLUSIONS: High total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake was associated with increased PC aggressiveness, with a suggestion of a stronger effect in men not using statins. The association between total fat-adjusted cholesterol intake and PC aggressiveness was most pronounced in European Americans.",2017,Mar,Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis,20,1,48-54,,10.1038/pcan.2016.39,27595916,#8202,Allott 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Fecal Metabolites as Biomarkers for Predicting Food Intake by Healthy Adults.,Shinn LM; Mansharamani A; Baer DJ; Novotny JA; Charron CS; Khan NA; Zhu R; Holscher HD,"BACKGROUND: The fecal metabolome is affected by diet and includes metabolites generated by human and microbial metabolism. Advances in -omics technologies and analytic approaches have allowed researchers to identify metabolites and better utilize large data sets to generate usable information. One promising aspect of these advancements is the ability to determine objective biomarkers of food intake. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to utilize a multivariate, machine learning approach to identify metabolite biomarkers that accurately predict food intake. METHODS: Data were aggregated from 5 controlled feeding studies in adults that tested the impact of specific foods (almonds, avocados, broccoli, walnuts, barley, and oats) on the gastrointestinal microbiota. Fecal samples underwent GC-MS metabolomic analysis; 344 metabolites were detected in preintervention samples, whereas 307 metabolites were detected postintervention. After removing metabolites that were only detected in either pre- or postintervention and those undetectable in ≥80% of samples in all study groups, changes in 96 metabolites relative concentrations (treatment postintervention minus preintervention) were utilized in random forest models to 1) examine the relation between food consumption and fecal metabolome changes and 2) rank the fecal metabolites by their predictive power (i.e., feature importance score). RESULTS: Using the change in relative concentration of 96 fecal metabolites, 6 single-food random forest models for almond, avocado, broccoli, walnuts, whole-grain barley, and whole-grain oats revealed prediction accuracies between 47% and 89%. When comparing foods with one another, almond intake was differentiated from walnut intake with 91% classification accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal promise in utilizing fecal metabolites as objective complements to certain self-reported food intake estimates. Future research on other foods at different doses and dietary patterns is needed to identify biomarkers that can be applied in feeding study compliance and clinical settings.",2023,Jan,J Nutr,152,12,2956-2965,,10.1093/jn/nxac195,36040343,#8317,Shinn 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong study type; ,Maybe

METHODS: A prospective study was performed in eleven (7 W, 4 M) offspring of obese and type 2 diabetes patients. Subjects had a BMI > 25 Kg/m2, waist circumference (men/women) > 102/88, HBA1c < 6.5% and were regarded as insulin-resistant after an OGTT (Matsuda ISIm <4). They were randomly divided into three groups and underwent three dietary periods each of 28 days in a crossover design: a) diet high in saturated fat (SAT), b) diet rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA; Mediterranean diet) and c) diet rich in carbohydrate (CHO). RESULTS: Body weight and resting energy expenditure did not changed during the three dietary periods. Fasting serum glucose concentrations fell during MUFA-rich and CHO-rich diets compared with high-SAT diets (5.02 +/- 0.1, 5.03 +/- 0.1, 5.50 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, respectively. Anova < 0.05). The MUFA-rich diet improved insulin sensitivity, as indicated by lower homeostasis model analysis-insulin resistance (HOMA-ir), compared with CHO-rich and high-SAT diets (2.32 +/- 0.3, 2.52 +/- 0.4, 2.72 +/- 0.4, respectively, Anova < 0.01). After a MUFA-rich and high-SAT breakfasts (443 kcal) the postprandial integrated area under curve (AUC) of glucose and insulin were lowered compared with isocaloric CHO-rich breakfast (7.8 +/- 1.3, 5.84 +/- 1.2, 11.9 +/- 2.7 mmol . 180 min/L, Anova < 0.05; and 1004 +/- 147, 1253 +/- 140, 2667 +/- 329 pmol . 180 min/L, Anova <0.01, respectively); while the integrated glucagon-like peptide-1 response increased with MUFA and SAT breakfasts compared with isocaloric CHO-rich meals (4.22 +/- 0.7, 4.34 +/- 1.1, 1.85 +/- 1.1, respectively, Anova < 0.05). Fasting and postprandial HDL cholesterol concentrations rose with MUFA-rich diets, and the AUCs of triacylglycerol fell with the CHO-rich diet. Similarly fasting proinsulin (PI) concentration fell, while stimulated ratio PI/I was not changed by MUFA-rich diet. CONCLUSIONS: Weight maintenance with a MUFA-rich diet improves HOMA-ir and fasting proinsulin levels in insulin-resistant subjects.

The apolipoprotein E gene promoter (-219G/T) polymorphism determines insulin sensitivity in response to dietary fat in healthy young adults.,Moreno JA; Pérez-Jiménez F; Marín C; Pérez-Martínez P; Moreno R; Gómez P; Jiménez-Gómez Y; Paniagua JA; Lairon D; López-Miranda J,"Insulin sensitivity (IS) is determined by genetic and environmental factors, including diet. The apoE gene promoter -219G/T polymorphism is associated with coronary heart disease and increased postprandial triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein concentration, circumstances related to insulin resistance. Thus, our aim was to determine whether this polymorphism modified the IS response to dietary fat in healthy young adults. Volunteers (n = 43) with the apoE3/E3 genotype (8 GG, 25 GT and 10 TT) completed 3 dietary periods, each lasting 4 wk. They first consumed a SFA-rich diet [38% fat (% of energy in the total diet), 20% SFA (% of energy in the total diet)], and then, in a randomized, crossover design, a carbohydrate (CHO)-rich diet (30% fat, 55% CHO) or a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diet (38% fat, 22% MUFA). After each diet period, we investigated peripheral IS using the insulin suppression test. The steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration was lower (P < 0.05) in GG subjects than in GT and TT individuals, regardless of the diet consumed. Significant diet x genotype interactions were found for SSPG and plasma nonesterified FFA (NEFA) concentrations. Thus, the shift from the SFA-rich diet to the MUFA- or CHO-rich diets decreased (P < 0.05) the SSPG and NEFA concentrations in GG and GT, but not in TT subjects. In conclusion, carriers of the -219T allele are less insulin sensitive than GG individuals. Furthermore, only carriers of the -219G allele have improved IS when MUFA- or CHO-rich diets are consumed instead of a SFA-rich diet.",2005,Nov,J Nutr,135,11,2535-40,,10.1093/jn/135.11.2535,16251607,#8328,Moreno 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between the intake of macronutrients and a single measure of healthy ageing (ATHLOS Healthy Ageing Scale). METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from 9906 randomly selected citizens of Krakow (Poland) who were 45-69 years of age and participants of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study. Macronutrient intake was evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire. ATHLOS Health Ageing Scale was estimated from 41 variables in pooled data from 16 cohorts. Standardized beta coefficients were estimated using multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: In multivariable adjusted models, there were significant positive associations between the ATHLOS Healthy Ageing Scale score and intake of protein (b = 0.030, 95% CI 0.001; 0.059 in men; b = 0.056, 95% CI 0.027; 0.085 in women), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (b = 0.042, 95% CI 0.013; 0.071 in men; b = 0.035, 95% CI 0.006; 0.064 in women), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (b = 0.053, 95% CI 0.024; 0.082 in men; b = 0.063, 95% CI 0.034; 0.092 in women), and omega-3 PUFA (b = 0.031, 95% CI 0.002;0.060 in men; b = 0.054, 95% CI 0.026; 0.082 in women). Carbohydrate intake was inversely associated with the ATHLOS Healthy Ageing Scale in women. Total fat intake was positively associated with the ATHLOS Healthy Ageing Scale in men.

A high-monounsaturated-fat/low-carbohydrate diet improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients.,Parillo M; Rivellese AA; Ciardullo AV; Capaldo B; Giacco A; Genovese S; Riccardi G,"It is commonly believed that high-carbohydrate (CHO) diets improve peripheral insulin sensitivity; however, this concept is based on anecdotal evidence. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients treated with insulin, a high-monounsaturated-fat (MUFA) diet is more effective than a high-complex-CHO diet in reducing blood glucose levels. The aim of our study was to compare the effect of a high-MUFA diet and a high-CHO diet on peripheral insulin sensitivity and metabolic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Ten non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients aged 52 +/- 8 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 26.7 +/- 3.5 kg/m2 who were being treated with diet alone (n = 5) or with diet plus glibenclamide (n = 5) were randomly assigned to a 15-day period of either a high-MUFA/low-CHO diet (CHO, 40%; fat, 40%; protein, 20%; fiber, 24g) or a low-MUFA/high-CHO diet (CHO, 60%; fat, 20%; protein, 20%; fiber, 24g) and were then crossed-over to the other diet. Diets were similar in their content of monosaccharides, disaccharides, and saturated fats, and were administered to the patients in a metabolic ward.

Metabolic responses to dietary fatty acids in obese women.,Clevenger HC; Stevenson JL; Cooper JA,"BACKGROUND: The composition of fatty acids in a diet may differentially affect metabolism, thus playing a role in the development of obesity. Our purpose was to study the effects of three high-fat (HF) meals with different dietary fatty acid compositions on the thermic effect of meal (TEM) and substrate oxidation in obese premenopausal women. METHODS: 16 healthy obese women, aged 18-39 years, participated in a single-blinded randomized cross-over study, in which they consumed isocaloric HF meals (70% of energy from fat) rich in either saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fat (PUFA). Indirect calorimetry was used to measure respiratory gases for a 5-hour postprandial period. Data collected was used to determine respiratory exchange ratio (RER) for assessing substrate oxidation, and energy expenditure for the determination of TEM. RESULTS: There was a significant time effect on both substrate oxidation and TEM (p<0.05). With and without using RMR as a covariate, there were no significant differences in TEM between test meals (TEM of 10.8±0.8 vs 11.0±1.0 kcal ∗ 5 h for high-MUFA vs. high-SFA meals, respectively, p=0.06). No treatment difference was found for postprandial substrate utilization (4.9±0.4, 4.9±0.3 and 4.6±0.4 g of fat oxidation following SFA, MUFA, and PUFA-rich HF meals, respectively; 13.2±0.9, 13.3±0.5 and 13.9±0.6 g of carbohydrate oxidation following SFA, MUFA, and PUFA-rich HF meals, respectively).

APOA1 and APOA4 gene polymorphisms influence the effects of dietary fat on LDL particle size and oxidation in healthy young adults.,Gomez P; Perez-Martinez P; Marin C; Camargo A; Yubero-Serrano EM; Garcia-Rios A; Rodriguez F; Delgado-Lista J; Perez-Jimenez F; Lopez-Miranda J,"We investigated whether APOA1 and APOA4 genotypes interact with diet to determine changes in LDL size and their susceptibility to oxidative modifications.

For each diet, we determined susceptibility to oxidative modifications and LDL size. To investigate the combined effects of the APOA1 G-76A and APOA4 Thr347Ser single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), we defined 4 combined genotype groups: GG/ThrThr, GG/ThrSer, GA/ThrThr, and GA/ThrSer. After participants consumed the CHO diet, there was a significant decrease in LDL size with respect to high-fat diets in GG homozygotes for the APOA1 G-76A SNP. However, LDL size did not differ in GA carriers among participants consuming the 3 diets. Carriers of the A allele for this polymorphism had smaller LDL size as well as increased susceptibility to oxidation after the SFA diet than the GG homozygous. Moreover, the interaction between the APO A1 and APOA4 genotypes revealed that individuals with the GA/ThrSer genotype had larger LDL particle size during consumption of the MUFA diet than when they consumed the CHO diet. No differences in LDL oxidation were found in this analysis. Our study supports the concept that SNP in APOA1and APOA4 genes influences atherogenic characteristics of LDL particles in response to diet.",2010,Apr,J Nutr,140,4,773-8,,10.3945/jn.109.115964,20164363,#8380,Gomez 2010,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Patterns of food consumption among vegetarians and non-vegetarians.,Orlich MJ; Jaceldo-Siegl K; Sabaté J; Fan J; Singh PN; Fraser GE,"Vegetarian dietary patterns have been reported to be associated with a number of favourable health outcomes in epidemiological studies, including the Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2). Such dietary patterns may vary and need further characterisation regarding foods consumed. The aims of the present study were to characterise and compare the food consumption patterns of several vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets. Dietary intake was measured using an FFQ among more than 89 000 members of the AHS-2 cohort. Vegetarian dietary patterns were defined a priori, based on the absence of certain animal foods in the diet. Foods were categorised into fifty-eight minor food groups comprising seventeen major food groups. The adjusted mean consumption of each food group for the vegetarian dietary patterns was compared with that for the non-vegetarian dietary pattern. Mean consumption was found to differ significantly across the dietary patterns for all food groups. Increased consumption of many plant foods including fruits, vegetables, avocados, non-fried potatoes, whole grains, legumes, soya foods, nuts and seeds was observed among vegetarians. Conversely, reduced consumption of meats, dairy products, eggs, refined grains, added fats, sweets, snack foods and non-water beverages was observed among vegetarians. Thus, although vegetarian dietary patterns in the AHS-2 have been defined based on the absence of animal foods in the diet, they differ greatly with respect to the consumption of many other food groups. These differences in food consumption patterns may be important in helping to explain the association of vegetarian diets with several important health outcomes.",2014,Nov,Br J Nutr,112,10,1644-53,,10.1017/S000711451400261X,25247790,#8381,Orlich 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong outcomes; ,Maybe
Postprandial coagulation activation in overweight individuals after weight loss: acute and long-term effects of a high-monounsaturated fat diet and a low-fat diet.,Bladbjerg EM; Larsen TM; Due A; Jespersen J; Stender S; Astrup A,"Diet is important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and it has been suggested that a high-MUFA diet is more cardioprotective than a low-fat diet. We hypothesised that the postprandial thrombotic risk profile is improved most favourably by a high-MUFA diet compared with a low-fat diet. This was tested in a parallel intervention trial on overweight individuals (aged 28.4 (SD 4.7) years) randomly assigned to a MUFA-diet (35-45% of energy as fat; >20% as MUFA, n = 21) or a low-fat (LF) diet (20-30% of energy as fat, n = 22) for 6 months after a weight loss of ~10%. All foods were provided free of charge from a purpose-built supermarket. Meal tests designed after the same principles were performed before and after the dietary intervention, and blood samples were collected at 8.00 h (fasting), 12.00 h, and 18.00 h and analysed for factor VII coagulant activity (FVII:C), activated FVII, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI:Ag), and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. There were significant postprandial increases in F1 + 2 and D-dimer before and after dietary intervention, with significantly lower values after 6 months. No significant differences were observed between the postprandial changes induced by the two diets. The postprandial decrease in FVII:C and PAI:Ag did not differ before and after intervention, irrespective of the diets. Our findings suggest postprandial coagulation activation in overweight subjects with more pronounced acute than long-term effects. We observed similar effects of the MUFA diet and the LF diet on the postprandial prothrombotic risk profile.",2014,Mar,Thromb Res,133,3,327-33,,10.1016/j.thromres.2013.12.010,24369828,#8382,Bladbjerg 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Long-term effect of varying the source or amount of dietary carbohydrate on postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, triacylglycerol, and free fatty acid concentrations in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.",Wolever TM; Mehling C,"BACKGROUND: Reducing the glycemic load (GL) is considered beneficial for managing insulin resistance. The GL can be reduced either by reducing carbohydrate intake or by reducing the glycemic index (GI). OBJECTIVE: We studied whether these 2 dietary maneuvers have the same long-term effects on postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, triacylglycerol, and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). DESIGN: Thirty-four subjects with IGT were randomly assigned to high-carbohydrate, high-GI (high-GI); high-carbohydrate, low-GI (low-GI); and low-carbohydrate, high-monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diets for 4 mo. Plasma glucose, insulin, and FFAs were measured from 0800 to 1600 at baseline in response to high-GI meals (60% carbohydrate, GI = 61, GL = 63) and after 4 mo in response to meals representative of the study diet. RESULTS: Carbohydrate intake (% of energy), GI, and GL in the high-GI, low-GI, and MUFA groups (breakfast and lunch meals combined), respectively, were 60%, 61, and 63; 60%, 53, and 55; and 49%, 61, and 52. Compared with the change after 4 mo of the high-GI diet, both the low-GI and MUFA diets reduced 0-8-h mean plasma glucose concentrations by 0.35 mmol/L (P < 0.05). Mean plasma insulin was approximately 20% higher (P < 0.05) and FFAs approximately 12% lower (P < 0.05) after the low-GI diet than after the high-GI diet, with no significant effect of MUFA. Changes in 0-8-h mean plasma triacylglycerols in the 3 treatment groups differed significantly: -0.14, 0.04, and 0.18 mmol/L, respectively, with the high-GI, MUFA, and low-GI diets. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with IGT, reducing the GI of the diet for 4 mo reduced postprandial plasma glucose by the same amount as did reducing carbohydrate intake.

Responses to high-fat challenges varying in fat type in subjects with different metabolic risk phenotypes: a randomized trial.,van Dijk SJ; Mensink M; Esser D; Feskens EJ; Müller M; Afman LA,"BACKGROUND: The ability of subjects to respond to nutritional challenges can reflect the flexibility of their biological system. Nutritional challenge tests could be used as an indicator of health status but more knowledge on metabolic and immune responses of different subjects to nutritional challenges is needed. The aim of this study was to compare the responses to high-fat challenges varying in fat type in subjects with different metabolic risk phenotypes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a cross-over design 42 men (age 50-70 y) consumed three high-fat shakes containing saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA) or n-3 polyunsaturated (PUFA). Men were selected on BMI and health status (lean, obese or obese diabetic) and phenotyped with MRI for adipose tissue distribution. Before and 2 and 4 h after shake consumption blood was drawn for measurement of expression of metabolic and inflammation-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma triglycerides (TAG), glucose, insulin, cytokines and ex vivo PBMC immune response capacity. The MUFA and n-3 PUFA challenge, compared to the SFA challenge, induced higher changes in expression of inflammation genes MCP1 and IL1β in PBMCs. Obese and obese diabetic subjects had different PBMC gene expression and metabolic responses to high-fat challenges compared to lean subjects. The MUFA challenge induced the most pronounced TAG response, mainly in obese and obese diabetic subjects. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The PBMC gene expression response and metabolic response to high-fat challenges were affected by fat type and metabolic risk phenotype. Based on our results we suggest using a MUFA challenge to reveal differences in response capacity of subjects.

"Effect of energy restriction, weight loss, and diet composition on plasma lipids and glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes.",Heilbronn LK; Noakes M; Clifton PM,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal diet for improving glucose and lipid profiles in obese patients with type 2 diabetes during moderate energy restriction. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 35 free-living obese patients with type 2 diabetes were assigned to one of three 1,600 kcal/day diets for 12 weeks. The diets were high carbohydrate (10% fat, 4% saturated), high monounsaturated fat (MUFA) (32% fat, 7% saturated), or high saturated fat (SFA) (32% fat, 17% saturated). RESULTS: Diet composition did not affect the magnitude of weight loss, with subjects losing an average of 6.6 +/- 0.9 kg. Energy restriction and weight loss resulted in reductions in fasting plasma glucose (-14%), insulin (-27%), GHb (-14%), and systolic (-7%) and diastolic blood pressure (-10%) levels and the glucose response area (-17%) independent of diet composition. Diet composition did affect the lipoprotein profile. LDL was 10% and 17% lower with the high-carbohydrate and high-MUFA diets, respectively, whereas no change was observed with the high-SFA diet (P < 0.001 for effect of diet). HDL was transiently reduced on the high-carbohydrate diet at weeks 1, 4, and 8, whereas higher fat consumption maintained these levels. The total cholesterol:HDL ratio, although significantly reduced on the high-MUFA diet (P < 0.01), was not different from the other two diets after adjustment for baseline differences. CONCLUSIONS: Energy restriction, independent of diet composition, improves glycemic control; however, reducing SFA intake by replacing SFA with carbohydrate or MUFA reduces LDL maximally during weight loss and to a greater degree than has been shown in weight-stable studies.",1999,Jun,Diabetes Care,22,6,889-95,,10.2337/diacare.22.6.889,10372237,#8397,Heilbronn 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Comparison of the effect of saturated and monounsaturated fat on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentration in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.,Ilic S; Jovanovic L; Pettitt DJ,"The goal of this study was to determine whether the type of fat plays a role in the glucose response to a meal, independent of the carbohydrate content. Ten gestational diabetic women (gestational weeks 29-34) who were well controlled on diet alone were randomized as to the order in which they would eat a meal, after overnight fast, containing saturated fat (SF) or monounsaturated fat (MUFA). Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 120, and 180 min for plasma glucose, insulin, lipid profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol) and free fatty acids. After 2 weeks, each patient received the other type of meal. The test meal was composed of 20% of the total daily caloric needs based on ideal body weight. The area under the curve showed a significantly lower glucose concentration for SF meal (p = 0.001). Serum insulin concentrations followed the glucose response with the peak at the 60-min time point and a significantly lower concentration at the 180-min time point in the SF than in the MUFA group. The present study demonstrated that the addition of SF to the meal resulted in lower postprandial glucose and insulin than when the meal contained MUFA. Thus, SF may be useful in controlling postprandial glucose.",1999,,Am J Perinatol,16,9,489-95,,10.1055/s-1999-6801,10774766,#8398,Ilic 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

Apolipoprotein E gene promoter -219G->T polymorphism increases LDL-cholesterol concentrations and susceptibility to oxidation in response to a diet rich in saturated fat.,Moreno JA; Pérez-Jiménez F; Marín C; Gómez P; Pérez-Martínez P; Moreno R; Bellido C; Fuentes F; López-Miranda J,"BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene promoter polymorphism (-219G-->T) has been associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, premature coronary artery disease, and decreased plasma apolipoprotein E concentrations. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine in healthy subjects whether this polymorphism modifies the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and the lipid response to the content and quality of dietary fat. DESIGN: Fifty-five healthy men with the APOE3/E3 genotype (7 GG, 38 GT, and 10 TT) completed 3 dietary periods, each lasting 4 wk. The first was a saturated fatty acid (SFA)-rich diet [38% fat-20% SFA and 12% monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-and 47% carbohydrates (CHO)], which was followed by a CHO-rich diet (30% fat-<10% SFA and 12% MUFA-and 55% CHO) or a MUFA-rich diet (38% fat-<10% SFA and 22% MUFA-and 47% CHO) in a randomized crossover design. At the end of each dietary period, LDL oxidation susceptibility, lipids, and lipoproteins were measured. RESULTS: Compared with carriers of the G allele, TT subjects had a significantly (P < 0.05) shorter lag time after the SFA diet. The replacement of the SFA diet by the CHO or MUFA diet induced a greater increase (P < 0.05) in lag time in the TT subjects than in the GG or GT subjects.

Mediterranean diet and all-cause mortality: A cohort of Italian men.,Trevisan M; Krogh V; Grioni S; Farinaro E,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The present study analyzes the relation between diet and all-cause mortality in a cohort of Italian men residing in different regions of Italy. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cohort was established using the members of the Associazione Nazionale Alpini, a voluntary organization that enlists individuals who have served in the Alpine troup; a mountain warfare infantry corps of the Italian Army. For the purpose of these analyses a total of 5049 participants were followed for an average of seven years. At baseline information was collected regarding age, education, life style habits, with special emphasis on diet (with the use of a validated dietary questionnaire), smoking and alcohol use. A total of 190 deaths were ascertained. In multivariate analyses the consumption of a Mediterranean type diet was inversely associated with mortality. Additional findings of relevance include: an inverse association between mortality and intake of vegetable fats and proteins, monounsaturated (MUFA) fats of vegetable origins, starch and folic acid. Positive association were evident between mortality and intake of animal fats, MUFA of animal origins and sugar. CONCLUSIONS: This study, focusing on a homogenous cohort characterized by a varied intake and high intake of monounsaturated fats, confirms the inverse association between a Mediterranean type diet and mortality and points out that the nature of the MUFA may be relevant for their effects on health. In addition, the study confirms that fats of animal origins and dietary sugar are associated with an overall deleterious effect on mortality.",2020,Sep,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,30,10,1673-1678,,10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.034,32736955,#8404,Trevisan 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

A saturated fatty acid-rich diet induces an obesity-linked proinflammatory gene expression profile in adipose tissue of subjects at risk of metabolic syndrome.,van Dijk SJ; Feskens EJ; Bos MB; Hoelen DW; Heijligenberg R; Bromhaar MG; de Groot LC; de Vries JH; Müller M; Afman LA,"BACKGROUND: Changes in dietary fat composition could lower the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Adipose tissue is an interesting tissue in this respect because of its role in lipid metabolism and inflammation. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the effect of a saturated fatty acid (SFA)- and a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diet on insulin sensitivity, serum lipids, and gene expression profiles of adipose tissue in subjects at risk of metabolic syndrome. DESIGN: A parallel controlled-feeding trial was conducted in 20 abdominally overweight subjects. Subjects received an SFA diet or a MUFA diet for 8 wk. Plasma and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were obtained, and insulin sensitivity was measured by using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Adipose tissue samples underwent whole-genome microarray and histologic analysis. Plasma and adipose tissue fatty acid composition and concentrations of serum cholesterol and plasma cytokine were determined. RESULTS: Consumption of the SFA diet resulted in increased expression of genes involved in inflammation processes in adipose tissue, without changes in morphology or insulin sensitivity. The MUFA diet led to a more antiinflammatory gene expression profile, which was accompanied by a decrease in serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations and an increase in plasma and adipose tissue oleic acid content. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of an SFA diet resulted in a proinflammatory ""obesity-linked"" gene expression profile, whereas consumption of a MUFA diet caused a more antiinflammatory profile. This suggests that replacement of dietary SFA with MUFA could prevent adipose tissue inflammation and may reduce the risk of inflammation-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome.

Existing studies have focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed individually, which only explain a limited fraction of the variability of these complex phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify combinations of SNPs associated with the variability in LDL cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) concentration changes following 5 dietary interventions. DESIGN: In a multicenter randomized crossover trial, 92 participants with elevated waist circumference and low HDL cholesterol concentrations consumed 5 isoenergetic diets for 4 wk: a diet rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) from cheese, SFA from butter, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and a diet higher in carbohydrates (CHO). The association between 22 candidate SNPs in genes involved in lipid and bile acid metabolism and transport and changes in LDL cholesterol and TG concentrations was assessed with univariate statistics followed by partial least squares regression. RESULTS: Endpoint LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly different (cheese: 3.18 ± 0.04, butter: 3.31 ± 0.04, MUFA: 3.00 ± 0.04, PUFA: 2.81 ± 0.04, CHO: 3.11 ± 0.04 mmol/L; P < 0.001) while endpoint TG concentrations were not (P = 0.117).

Indices of fatty acid desaturase activity in healthy human subjects: effects of different types of dietary fat.,Vessby B; Gustafsson IB; Tengblad S; Berglund L,"Δ9-Desaturase (stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, SCD-1) regulates the desaturation of SFA, mainly stearic and palmitic, to MUFA. Δ6-Desaturase (D6D) and Δ5-desaturase (D5D) are involved in the metabolism of linoleic and α-linolenic acid to polyunsaturated metabolites. The objective of the present study was to study the effects of different types of dietary fat on indices of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) activity (evaluated as product:precursor ratios) in plasma and skeletal muscle in human subjects. A high SCD-1 index has been related to obesity and metabolic disorders, while the D5D index is associated with insulin sensitivity. Fatty acid composition of serum and skeletal muscle lipids was analysed by GLC during a randomised, controlled, 3-month dietary intervention in healthy subjects. A comparison of the effects of a diet containing butter fat (SFA, n 17) with a diet containing monounsaturated fat (MUFA, n 17), keeping all other dietary components constant, showed a reduced SCD-1 activity index by 20% on the MUFA diet compared with the SFA diet assessed in serum cholesteryl esters. The D6D and D5D indices remained unaffected. Supplementation with long-chain n-3 fatty acids reduced the SCD-1 index by a similar magnitude while the D6D index decreased and the D5D index increased. It is concluded that changes in the type of fat in the diet affect the indices of FADS activity in serum and skeletal muscle in human subjects.

A meal enriched in saturated fat acutely impairs cognitive performance in obese men.,Ruegsegger GN; Rappaport CI; Hill JJ; Jochum KA; Challeen ES; Roth MC,"BACKGROUND: Diets chronically high in saturated fat (SFA) associate with obesity and insulin resistance (IR), which in turn associate with cognitive decline and dementia. However, understanding how acute SFA consumption influences cognition is less clear despite short-term SFA-enriched diets inducing whole-body IR. We examined how consuming meals enriched with SFA or monounsaturated fat (MUFA) acutely influence cognitive function in lean and obese men. We hypothesized that greater diet-induced IR following a SFA-enriched meal would associate with decreased cognitive performance. METHODS: Twelve lean and 12 obese males ingested meals containing no fat (CTL), enriched with SFA, or enriched with MUFA in a single-blind, randomized fashion. Cognitive testing and blood sampling were performed pre- and 2 h post-meal. Oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) and body composition were also assessed. RESULTS: At baseline, fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglyceride, IL-6, and 2-hr glucose during an OGTT were higher in obese men (p < 0.001), while executive function (Stroop Test and Trail Making Test B-A) and working memory (Digit Span Test) were lower in obese men (p < 0.05). In response to the CTL and MUFA-enriched, no differences in cognitive measures were observed in lean or obese subjects. Following a SFA-enriched meal, obese subjects scored worse during cognitive testing (Stroop Test, Trail Making Test B-A, and Digit Span Test) compared to pre-meal scores (p < 0.05). These impairments in cognitive testing scores following the SFA-enriched meal associated with increased HOMA-IR (p < 0.01) and decreased plasma IL-6 (p < 0.05). No changes in cognitive function were observed in lean subjects following a SFA-enriched meal.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of an eight-week ketogenic diet rich in n-3 fatty acids on fasting serum lipoproteins and postprandial triacylglycerol (TG) responses. DESIGN: Ten men consumed a low-carbohydrate diet rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and supplemented with n-3 fatty acids for eight weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after one week of habitual diet and on two consecutive days after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of the intervention diet. Postprandial TG responses to a fat-rich test meal were measured prior to and after the intervention diet. RESULTS: Compared to the habitual diet, subjects consumed significantly (p < or = 0.05) greater quantities of protein, fat, MUFA and n-3 fatty acids and significantly less total energy, carbohydrate and dietary fiber. Body weight significantly declined over the experimental period (-4.2+/-2.7 kg). Compared to baseline, fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were not significantly different after the intervention diet (+1.5%, +9.7% and +10.0%, respectively). Fasting TG were significantly reduced after the intervention diet (-55%). There was a significant reduction in peak postprandial TG (-42%) and TG area under the curve (-48%) after the intervention diet. CONCLUSIONS: A hypocaloric low-carbohydrate diet rich in MUFA and supplemented with n-3 fatty acids significantly reduced postabsorptive and postprandial TG in men that were not hypertriglyceridemic as a group before the diet. This may be viewed as a clinically significant positive adaptation in terms of cardiovascular risk status. However, transient increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were also evident and should be examined further in regard to which particular subfractions are elevated.",2000,Jun,J Am Coll Nutr,19,3,383-91,,10.1080/07315724.2000.10718935,10872901,#8454,Volek 2000,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Increasing the proportion of plasma MUFA, as a result of dietary intervention, is associated with a modest improvement in insulin sensitivity.",Johns I; Frost G; Dornhorst A,"The effect of modifying dietary fatty acid (FA) composition on insulin sensitivity remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether changes in plasma phospholipid (PL) FA composition, as a result of dietary intervention, correspond with changes in insulin sensitivity. The RISCK study was a 6-month randomised controlled dietary intervention study, which assessed the effect of modifying dietary fat and the glycaemic index (GI) of carbohydrates on insulin sensitivity. Total NEFA levels, fasting plasma PL FA profiles and an insulin sensitivity index (Si), derived from intravenous glucose tolerance minimal-model analysis, were available from 533 participants, all at elevated risk of type 2 diabetes. Bivariate correlations between changes in saturated PL FA (SFA), MUFA (as a percentage of total plasma NEFA) and changes in Si were assessed according to treatment group. Age, sex, ethnicity, percentage change in body mass and change in dietary GI were controlled for. Increasing total NEFA concentration was associated with worsening Si (r -0·152; P = 0·001). In the high-MUFA/low-GI diet group, change in PL-MUFA was positively and independently associated with change in Si (r 0·297; P = 0·002). Among MUFA, change in oleic acid (18 : 1) was most strongly correlated with change in Si (r 0·266; P = 0·005), as was change in minor FA 24 : 1 (r 0·244; P = 0·011) and 17 : 1 (r 0·196; P = 0·042). In the high-SFA/high-GI group, change in SFA concentration was not significantly associated with change in Si.

Dietary fat intake and liver cancer incidence: A population-based cohort study in Chinese men.,Ji XW; Wang J; Shen QM; Li ZY; Jiang YF; Liu DK; Tan YT; Li HL; Xiang YB,"To date, limited studies have focused on the association between dietary fat and liver cancer risk, especially in China. Our study aims to evaluate the association between dietary fat intake and liver cancer incidence risk in men. Dietary fat intake was obtained through a validated food frequency questionnaire in a Chinese prospective cohort. The Cox regression model was utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). After exclusion, 59 998 recruitments were finally analyzed with a total follow-up time of 714 339 person-years, 431 incident liver cancer cases were newly identified among them. The adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for the highest vs lowest quartile of total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) were 1.33 (1.01-1.75), 1.50 (1.13-1.97), 1.26 (0.96-1.65), and 1.41 (1.07-1.86), and the corresponding P-trend values were .008, .005, .034, and .005, respectively. In the secondary analysis among participants tested for hepatitis B virus, we found that higher intakes of saturated fat and PUFA were also associated with increased liver cancer risks. Besides, high risks of per standard deviation alterations of the total fat, saturated fat and MUFA were detected in liver cancer, and these results were similar to those concluded from the full-cohort analysis. In conclusion, dietary intakes of total fat, saturated fat, PUFA, and probably MUFA might increase liver cancer risks. Our study provides suggestive advice to public administration on dietary suggestions, and related measures taken from managing dietary fat intake might reduce liver cancer incidence.",2021,Jun,Int J Cancer,148,12,2982-2996,,10.1002/ijc.33507,33559177,#8461,Ji 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Beneficial effects of designed dietary fatty acid compositions on lipids in triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins among Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Dai J; Su YX; Bartell S; Le NA; Ling WH; Liang YQ; Gao L; Wu HY; Veledar E; Vaccarino V,"Elevated levels of postprandial triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (ppTRLs) are atherogenic. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have exaggerated postprandial lipemia associated with elevation or prolonged residence of ppTRL remnants. We examined whether dietary fatty acid compositions (DFACs) decrease atherogenic lipid profiles in ppTRL subfractions in T2DM Chinese patients. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted among 28 T2DM patients. Patients consumed 1 of 3 standardized DFAC-specific fat meals: equidominant (1:1:1), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-dominant (PUFA-D, 1:1.7:2.3), or monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-dominant (MUFA-D, 1:1.7:1.2) meals. Numbers in parenthesis, respectively, represent the ratio of saturated fatty acids, MUFA, and PUFA to saturated fatty acids. The MUFA-D meal was the control. Triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels were measured in Svedberg flotation rate (S(f)) greater than 400, S(f) 60 to 400, S(f) 20 to 60, and S(f) 12 to 20 ppTRL subfractions at fasting (0 hour) and 2, 4, and 6 hours after the consumption of the fat meals. Effects of DFACs on mean concentrations of triacylglycerols and cholesterol averaged over 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours in ppTRL subfractions were assessed using linear mixed models. Stability and robustness were validated with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Contrasted to the control, equidominant meal reduced 6-hour average triacylglycerol levels in S(f) greater than 400 (P = .002, bootstrap P < .05) and S(f) 20 to 60 (P = .02, bootstrap P < .05) subfractions, and decreased average S(f) 20 to 60 cholesterol (P = .04, bootstrap P < .05); PUFA-D decreased S(f) greater than 400 average triacylglycerol levels (P = .09, bootstrap P < .05). Bootstrap samples suggested that PUFA-D decreased average S(f) 20 to 60 cholesterol levels (bootstrap P < .05). Therefore, modifying DFACs attenuates the atherogenic lipid profile of ppTRLs in T2DM patients; but increasing PUFA ratio may be more feasible.",2009,Apr,Metabolism,58,4,510-8,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00467168,10.1016/j.metabol.2008.11.010,19303972,#8462,Dai 2009,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Long-term effects on haemostatic variables of three ad libitum diets differing in type and amount of fat and carbohydrate: a 6-month randomised study in obese individuals.,Bladbjerg EM; Larsen TM; Due A; Jespersen J; Stender S; Astrup A,"Diet is important in the prevention of CVD, and it has been suggested that a diet high in MUFA is more cardioprotective than a low-fat diet. We hypothesised that the thrombotic risk profile is improved most favourably by a high-MUFA diet compared with a low-fat diet. This was tested in a parallel randomised intervention trial on overweight individuals (aged 28·2 (sd 4·6) years) randomly assigned to a diet providing a moderate amount of fat (35-45 % of energy; >20 % of fat as MUFA) (MUFA diet; n 39), to a low-fat (LF; 20-30 % of energy) diet (n 43), or to a control diet (35 % of energy as fat; n 24) for 6 months after a weight loss of about 10 %. Protein constituted 10-20 % of energy in all three diets. All foods were provided free of charge from a purpose-built supermarket. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after intervention and analysed for factor VII coagulant activity (FVII:c), fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), D-dimer and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). The fibrinogen concentration was significantly lowered by the LF diet, but not by the MUFA diet. Changes in fibrinogen differed significantly between diet groups. BMI and PAI concentration increased and D-dimer concentrations were reduced irrespective of the diets. No changes were observed for FVII:c and F1+2.

Dietary fatty acid intake in hemodialysis patients and associations with circulating fatty acid profiles: A cross-sectional study.,Khor BH; Sahathevan S; Sualeheen A; Ali MSM; Narayanan SS; Chinna K; Gafor AHA; Goh BL; Ahmad G; Morad Z; Daud ZAM; Khosla P; Sundram K; Karupaiah T,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were threefold: first, to assess the dietary fatty acid (FA) intake and blood FA status in Malaysian patients on hemodialysis (HD); second, to examine the association between dietary FA intakes and blood FA profiles in patients on HD; and third, to determine whether blood FAs could serve as a biomarker of dietary fat intake quality in these patients. METHODS: Using 3 d of dietary records, FA intakes of 333 recruited patients were calculated using a food database built from laboratory analyses of commonly consumed Malaysian foods. Plasma triacylglycerol (TG) and erythrocyte FAs were determined by gas chromatography. RESULTS: High dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) consumption trends were observed. Patients on HD also reported low dietary ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumptions and low levels of TG and erythrocyte FAs. TG and dietary FAs were significantly associated respective to total PUFA, total ω-6 PUFA, 18:2 ω-6, total ω-3 PUFA, 18:3 ω-3, 22:6 ω-3, and trans 18:2 isomers (P < 0.05). Contrarily, only dietary total ω-3 PUFA and 22:6 ω-3 were significantly associated with erythrocyte FAs (P < 0.01). The highest tertile of fish and shellfish consumption reflected a significantly higher proportion of TG 22:6 ω-3. Dietary SFAs were directly associated with TG and erythrocyte MUFA, whereas dietary PUFAs were not. CONCLUSION: TG and erythrocyte FAs serve as biomarkers of dietary PUFA intake in patients on HD. Elevation of circulating MUFA may be attributed to inadequate intake of PUFAs.",2019,Jul-Aug,Nutrition,63-64,,14-21,,10.1016/j.nut.2019.01.005,30927642,#8489,Khor 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of monounsaturated vs. saturated fat on postprandial lipemia and adipose tissue lipases in type 2 diabetes.,Rivellese AA; Giacco R; Annuzzi G; De Natale C; Patti L; Di Marino L; Minerva V; Costabile G; Santangelo C; Masella R; Riccardi G,"BACKGROUND: The effects of different dietary fatty acids on postprandial lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients are still debated. AIM: To evaluate the effects of monounsaturated (MUFA) vs. saturated fat (SAFA)-rich diets on postprandial lipemia and adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven type 2 diabetic patients followed, in random order, a diet rich in MUFA (SAFA 8%, MUFA 23%) and another rich in SAFA (SAFA 17%, MUFA 15%) for a period of 3 weeks each. At the end of the two diets, a standard fat-rich meal was administered and subcutaneous fat biopsies were performed at fasting and 6h after the test meal. RESULTS: Neither diet induced significant changes in meal lipid tolerance, except for a faster (at 2h) increase in chylomicron triglycerides and a significant decrease in small VLDL triglyceride incremental area after the MUFA diet (-13.6+/-4.7 mg/dl*6h vs. -2.2+/-3.7 mg/dl*6h, p<0.005) (M+/-SEM).

"Effect of changing the amount and type of fat and carbohydrate on insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular risk: the RISCK (Reading, Imperial, Surrey, Cambridge, and Kings) trial.",Jebb SA; Lovegrove JA; Griffin BA; Frost GS; Moore CS; Chatfield MD; Bluck LJ; Williams CM; Sanders TA,"BACKGROUND: Insulin sensitivity (Si) is improved by weight loss and exercise, but the effects of the replacement of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or carbohydrates of high glycemic index (HGI) or low glycemic index (LGI) are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a dietary intervention trial to study these effects in participants at risk of developing metabolic syndrome. DESIGN: We conducted a 5-center, parallel design, randomized controlled trial [RISCK (Reading, Imperial, Surrey, Cambridge, and Kings)]. The primary and secondary outcomes were changes in Si (measured by using an intravenous glucose tolerance test) and cardiovascular risk factors. Measurements were made after 4 wk of a high-SFA and HGI (HS/HGI) diet and after a 24-wk intervention with HS/HGI (reference), high-MUFA and HGI (HM/HGI), HM and LGI (HM/LGI), low-fat and HGI (LF/HGI), and LF and LGI (LF/LGI) diets. RESULTS: We analyzed data for 548 of 720 participants who were randomly assigned to treatment. The median Si was 2.7 × 10(-4) mL · μU(-1) · min(-1) (interquartile range: 2.0, 4.2 × 10(-4) mL · μU(-1) · min(-1)), and unadjusted mean percentage changes (95% CIs) after 24 wk treatment (P = 0.13) were as follows: for the HS/HGI group, -4% (-12.7%, 5.3%); for the HM/HGI group, 2.1% (-5.8%, 10.7%); for the HM/LGI group, -3.5% (-10.6%, 4.3%); for the LF/HGI group, -8.6% (-15.4%, -1.1%); and for the LF/LGI group, 9.9% (2.4%, 18.0%). Total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B concentrations decreased with SFA reduction. Decreases in TC and LDL-cholesterol concentrations were greater with LGI. Fat reduction lowered HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 and B concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not support the hypothesis that isoenergetic replacement of SFAs with MUFAs or carbohydrates has a favorable effect on Si. Lowering GI enhanced reductions in TC and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in subjects, with tentative evidence of improvements in Si in the LF-treatment group.

A high-trans fatty acid diet and insulin sensitivity in young healthy women.,Louheranta AM; Turpeinen AK; Vidgren HM; Schwab US; Uusitupa MI,"Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that a diet rich in saturated fat affects insulin sensitivity. Monoenes and dienes that have an usaturated bond with the trans configuration (trans fatty acids) resemble saturated fatty acids with respect to structure, but no published data are available on the effect of trans fatty acids on insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the effects of diets high in trans fatty acids (TFA diet) and oleic acid (monounsaturated fat [MUFA] diet) on glucose and lipid metabolism were studied in 14 healthy women. Subjects consumed both experimental diets for 4 weeks according to a randomized crossover study design. Both experimental diet periods were preceded by consumption of a standardized baseline diet for 2 weeks. The diets provided 36.6% to 37.9% of energy (E%) as fat. In the TFA diet, there was 5.1 E% trans fatty acids, and in the MUFA diet, 5.2 E% oleic acid, substituted for saturated fatty acids in the baseline diet. A frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) was performed at the end of the experimental diet periods. Glucose effectiveness (S(G)) and the insulin sensitivity index (S(I)) did not differ after the two experimental diet periods. There was also no difference in the acute insulin response between the diets. The total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio and serum total triglyceride, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) triglyceride and apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentrations were higher (P < .05) after the TFA diet.

Dietary intake and gene variation influence the response of plasma lipids to dietary intervention.,Talmud PJ; Boerwinkle E; Xu CF; Tikkanen MJ; Pietinen P; Huttunen JK; Humphries S,"We have examined whether variation at the apolipoprotein (apo) B, apo E, apo AII, and apo AI-CIII-AIV genes affected the relationship between dietary intake and serum lipid traits in individuals who had participated in dietary intervention from a basal high fat diet to a low fat diet followed by a return to their natural diet, the switchback. On both the basal and switchback diets where the variance of dietary intake was great, there was a significant correlation between P/S ratio and serum total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apo AI levels. In addition dietary cholesterol (dchol) levels correlated significantly with serum apo AI levels on the basal diet. Comparing the difference between basal and intervention (delta 1) and between switchback and intervention diets (delta 2), changes in dchol and P/S ratio correlated significantly with changes in serum total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL cholesterol, and apo B levels. There was a significant correlation between monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and apo AI levels during both changes. Furthermore we have examined whether the relationship between variables was homogeneous among genotypes of candidate gene polymorphisms. A heterogeneous effect (P less than 0.01) was seen among genotypes of the PvuII-AIV restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) on the correlation of serum LDL cholesterol levels and dietary MUFA during both dietary changes (delta 1 and delta 2). A heterogeneous effect among genotypes of the apo B XbaI RFLP on the correlation between dchol versus total and LDL cholesterol during the change delta 1, but not delta 2, was observed.

Orange juice modulates proinflammatory cytokines after high-fat saturated meal consumption.,Rocha DMUP; Lopes LL; da Silva A; Oliveira LL; Bressan J; Hermsdorff HHM,"We aimed to evaluate the postprandial secretion of inflammatory markers induced by SFA or MUFA high-fat meal consumption and whether orange juice intake could modulate this induction. This study included 55 healthy women (aged 20 to 40 years): 33 participants received an SFA high-fat meal (≈1000 kcal, 37.6% of energy intake (E) from SFA) and 22 participants received an MUFA high-fat meal (≈1000 kcal, 56.3% E from MUFA). Both interventions were accompanied by 500 ml of orange juice (test) or water (control). The plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) and CRP were determined before (fasting) and 2, 3 and 5 hours after the test meal intake. The SFA high-fat meal induced a significant increase in AUC values (for TNF-α, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-2 adjusted for baseline concentrations) in comparison with MUFA high-fat meal intervention. The results were independent of the drink which accompanied the meal (water or orange juice). Both IL-4 and IL-17A AUC values were significantly increased after an SFA high-fat meal intake, accompanied by water, but not by orange juice. In addition, these values were higher in relation to MUFA high-fat meal interventions. Also, IL-17A significantly increased at 3 h after an SFA high-fat meal intake accompanied by water, but not by orange juice. Overall, our conclusions indicate an anti-inflammatory effect of MUFA compared to SFA high-fat meal intake, while orange juice intake was able to mitigate the subclinical increase of postprandial inflammation, induced by SFA high-fat meal consumption, for a particular biomarker (IL-17A).",2017,Dec,Food Funct,8,12,4396-4403,,10.1039/c7fo01139c,29068453,#8508,RochaDMUP 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

Comparison of adipose tissue fatty acids with dietary fatty acids as measured by 24-hour recall and food frequency questionnaire in Black and White Adventists: the Adventist Health Study.,Knutsen SF; Fraser GE; Beeson WL; Lindsted KD; Shavlik DJ,"PURPOSE: To calibrate and compare intake of different fats and individual fatty acids as assessed with a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) against that estimated with (i) a series of dietary recalls and; (ii) the relative fat concentration in an adipose tissue biopsy. The FFQ was specially designed for use in a cohort of Seventh-day Adventists. In preparation for a large cohort study investigating the effect of diet on risk of colon, prostate and breast cancer. METHODS: The association of adipose tissue fatty acids and dietary fat intake was assessed in 49 black and 72 white Seventh-day Adventists subjects using 8 different 24-hour recalls, a 200-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and adipose tissue biopsies from each subject. RESULTS: Pearson correlation between fatty acids in adipose tissue and dietary intake as assessed by multiple 24-hour recalls were as follows: Linoleic acid: 0.77 in black and 0.71 in white subjects, respectively; Linolenic acid: 0.68 (blacks) and 0.62 (whites); Total Polyunsaturated fat (PUFA): 0.78 (blacks) and 0.70 (whites); Total Monounsaturated fat (MUFA): 0.35 (blacks) and 0.03 (whites); Total Saturated fat (SFA): 0.46 (blacks) and 0.56 (whites). Correlations between fatty acids in adipose tissue and dietary intake as assessed by FFQ were: Linoleic acid: 0.61 (blacks) and 0.52 (whites), respectively; Linolenic acid: 0.29 (blacks) and 0.49 (whites); PUFA: 0.62 (blacks) and 0.53 (whites); MUFA: 0.07 (blacks) and 0.31 (whites), SFA: 0.21 (blacks) and 0.31 (whites). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms findings of others that 24-hour recalls are valid for assessing dietary intake of different types of fat. The FFQ we developed and used in this study gave reasonably valid measures of fatty acid intake in our population and is thus suitable for use in large cohort studies. It had validity comparable to that observed for other FFQs.",2003,Feb,Ann Epidemiol,13,2,119-27,,10.1016/s1047-2797(02)00260-0,12559671,#8519,Knutsen 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of a low-fat diet enriched with oleic acid on postprandial lipemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Higashi K; Shige H; Ito T; Nakajima K; Ishikawa T; Nakamura H; Ohsuzu F,"The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a low-fat diet enriched with oleic acid to those of a low-fat diet enriched with linoleic acid on fasting lipids, postprandial lipemia, and oxidative susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In a 3-wk randomized crossover study, eight patients with type 2 DM were given an experimental low-fat diet enriched with either oleic acid or linoleic acid. The oleic-acid-enriched diet contained 5, 15, and 5%, energy from saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the linoleic-acid-enriched diet contained 5, 5, and 15% energy from saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively. In addition to evaluating the fasting lipids and oxidative susceptibility of LDL, we evaluated postprandial lipemia using an oral fat load at the end of each 3-wk dietary phase. There were no significant differences in fasting lipid profile or lag time of LDL oxidation between the two experimental dietary phases. The average and maximal increments of remnant-like particle (RLP) cholesterol levels during oral fat load were significantly higher after the oleic-acid-enriched dietary phase than after the linoleic-acid-enriched dietary phase. The area under the curve of RLP cholesterol was also significantly larger after the oleic-acid-enriched dietary phase than after the linoleic-acid-enriched dietary phase. These results suggest that the oleic-acid-enriched diet was associated with increased formation of postprandial chylomicron remnants compared with the linoleic-acid-enriched diet.",2001,Jan,Lipids,36,1,6-Jan,,10.1007/s11745-001-0660-5,11214722,#8542,Higashi 2001,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Associations between saturated fat intake and other dietary macronutrients and incident hypertension in a prospective study of French women.,MacDonald CJ; Madkia AL; Mounier-Vehier C; Severi G; Boutron-Ruault MC,"PURPOSE: Saturated fat has long been associated with cardiovascular disease in multiple prospective studies, and randomized controlled trials. Few studies have assessed the relative associations between saturated fat and other macronutrients with hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to assess the relative associations between saturated fat, other macronutrients such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat, proteins, and carbohydrates, and incident hypertension in a large prospective cohort of French women. METHODS: This study used data from the E3N cohort study, including participants free of hypertension at baseline. A food frequency questionnaire was used to determine dietary intakes of saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA), polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), animal protein (AP), vegetable protein (VP), carbohydrates (CH) and various foods. Cases of hypertension were based on self-report, validated by drug reimbursement data. Covariates were based on self-report. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the relative associations between different macronutrients and hypertension risk, using the 'substitution' framework. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: This study included 45,854 women free of hypertension at baseline. During 708,887 person-years of follow-up, 12,338 incident cases of hypertension were identified. Compared to saturated fat, higher consumption of all other macronutrients was associated with a lower risk of hypertension (HR(MUFA) = 0.74 [0.67: 0.81], HR(PUFA) = 0.84 [0.77: 0.92], HR(CH) = 0.83 [0.77: 0.88], HR(AP) = 0.91 [0.85: 0.97], HR(VP) = 0.93 [0.83: 1.03]). CONCLUSION: This study finds that relative to other macronutrients such as monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat, higher intake of saturated fat is associated with a higher risk of hypertension among women.",2023,Apr,Eur J Nutr,62,3,1207-1215,,10.1007/s00394-022-03053-0,36482209,#8550,MacDonald 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Intake of dietary fats and colorectal cancer risk: prospective findings from the UK Dietary Cohort Consortium.,Dahm CC; Keogh RH; Lentjes MA; Spencer EA; Key TJ; Greenwood DC; Cade JE; Burley VJ; Shipley MJ; Brunner EJ; Stephen AM; Mishra G; Kuh D; Fentiman IS; White IR; Luben R; Khaw KT; Rodwell Bingham SA,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemiologic evidence for an association between colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and total dietary fat, saturated fat (SF), monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) is inconsistent. Previous studies have used food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) to assess diet, but data from food diaries may be less prone to severe measurement error than data from FFQ. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within seven prospective UK cohort studies, comprising 579 cases of incident CRC and 1996 matched controls. Standardized dietary data from 4- to 7-day food diaries and from FFQ were used to estimate odds ratios for CRC risk associated with intake of fat and subtypes of fat using conditional logistic regression. We also calculated multivariate measurement error corrected odds ratios for CRC using repeated food diary measurements. RESULTS: We observed no associations between intakes of total dietary fat or types of fat and CRC risk, irrespective of whether dietary data were obtained using food diaries or FFQ.

Association Between Fatty Acid Intakes and Age-Related Macular Degeneration in a Japanese Population: JPHC-NEXT Eye Study.,Yasukawa T; Sasaki M; Motomura K; Yuki K; Kurihara T; Tomita Y; Mori K; Ozawa N; Ozawa Y; Yamagishi K; Hanyuda A; Sawada N; Tsubota K; Tsugane S; Iso H,"PURPOSE: To determine the associations between fatty acid intakes and the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) under a population-based cross-sectional study. METHODS: Residents of Chikusei City aged ≥40 years underwent systemic and eye screening. AMD was graded according to a modified version of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study classification. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and was adjusted for total energy intake. RESULTS: Altogether, 10,788 eyes of 5394 participants, 2116 men (mean [standard deviation (SD)] age, 62.4 [9.4] years) and 3278 women (60.6 [9.5] years), were included. The mean daily total fat intakes were 52.8 g and 59.0 g in men and women, respectively. After adjustments for potential confounders, saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake was inversely associated with the prevalence of any AMD in men (for each energy-adjusted 1-SD increase: odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.00). Significant trends were found for decreasing odds ratios of AMD with increasing SFA, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake (P for trend = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively). In women, only a significant association was observed between the second quartile of linolenic acid intake and the prevalence of any AMD (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: We found an inverse association of SFA intake and a weak inverse association of MUFA and PUFA intakes with the prevalence of any AMD in a Japanese population.

Changes in Types of Dietary Fats Influence Long-term Weight Change in US Women and Men.,Liu X; Li Y; Tobias DK; Wang DD; Manson JE; Willett WC; Hu FB,"BACKGROUND: The relation between dietary fat intake and body weight remains controversial. Few studies have examined long-term changes in types of dietary fat and weight change in longitudinal studies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine associations between intake of different types of fat and long-term weight change in US women and men. METHODS: The association between changes in consumption of varying types of fat and weight change was examined every 4 y through the use of multivariate models adjusted for age, baseline body mass index, and change in percentage energy from protein, intake of cereal fiber, fruits, and vegetables, alcohol use, and other lifestyle covariates in 3 prospective US cohorts, including 121,335 men and women free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or obesity over a 20- to 24-y follow-up. Dietary intakes and body weight were assessed via validated questionnaires. Cohort-specific results were pooled with the use of a random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: Compared with equivalent changes in carbohydrate intake, a 5% increase in energy from saturated fatty acid (SFA) and a 1% increase in energy from trans-fat were associated with 0.61 kg (95% CI: 0.54, 0.68 kg) and 0.69 kg (95% CI: 0.56, 0.84 kg) greater weight gain per 4-y period, respectively. A 5% increase in energy from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was associated with less weight gain (-0.55 kg; 95% CI: -0.81, -0.29 kg). Increased intake of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) from animal sources by 1% was associated with weight gain of 0.29 kg (95% CI: 0.25, 0.33 kg), whereas MUFA from plant sources was not associated with weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Different dietary fats have divergent associations with long-term weight change in US men and women.

"Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats had no impact on vascular function but beneficial effects on lipid biomarkers, E-selectin, and blood pressure: results from the randomized, controlled Dietary Intervention and VAScular function (DIVAS) study.",Vafeiadou K; Weech M; Altowaijri H; Todd S; Yaqoob P; Jackson KG; Lovegrove JA,"BACKGROUND: Public health strategies to lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk involve reducing dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake to ≤10% of total energy (%TE). However, the optimal type of replacement fat is unclear. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the substitution of 9.5-9.6%TE dietary SFAs with either monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on vascular function and other CVD risk factors. DESIGN: In a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group dietary intervention, 195 men and women aged 21-60 y from the United Kingdom with moderate CVD risk (≥50% above the population mean) followed one of three 16-wk isoenergetic diets (%TE target compositions, total fat:SFA:MUFA:n-6 PUFA) that were rich in SFAs (36:17:11:4, n = 65), MUFAs (36:9:19:4, n = 64), or n-6 PUFAs (36:9:13:10, n = 66). The primary outcome measure was flow-mediated dilatation; secondary outcome measures included fasting serum lipids, microvascular reactivity, arterial stiffness, ambulatory blood pressure, and markers of insulin resistance, inflammation, and endothelial activation. RESULTS: Replacing SFAs with MUFAs or n-6 PUFAs did not affect the percentage of flow-mediated dilatation (primary endpoint) or other measures of vascular reactivity. Of the secondary outcome measures, substitution of SFAs with MUFAs attenuated the increase in night systolic blood pressure (-4.9 mm Hg, P = 0.019) and reduced E-selectin (-7.8%, P = 0.012). Replacement with MUFAs or n-6 PUFAs lowered fasting serum total cholesterol (-8.4% and -9.2%, respectively), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-11.3% and -13.6%), and total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (-5.6% and -8.5%) (P ≤ 0.001). These changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol equate to an estimated 17-20% reduction in CVD mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of 9.5-9.6%TE dietary SFAs with either MUFAs or n-6 PUFAs did not significantly affect the percentage of flow-mediated dilatation or other measures of vascular function. However, the beneficial effects on serum lipid biomarkers, blood pressure, and E-selectin offer a potential public health strategy for CVD risk reduction.

A prospective cohort study was performed using data of 6942 participants in the PREDIMED trial, with yearly repeated validated food-frequency questionnaires, and anthropometric outcomes (median follow-up: 4.8 years). The effects of replacing dietary fat subtypes for one another, proteins or carbohydrates were estimated using generalized estimating equations substitution models. Replacement of 5% energy from saturated fatty acids (SFA) with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) resulted in weight changes of -0.38 kg (95% Confidece Iinterval (CI): -0.69, -0.07), and -0.51 kg (95% CI: -0.81, -0.20), respectively. Replacing proteins with MUFA or PUFA decreased the odds of becoming obese. Estimates for the daily substitution of one portion of red meat with white meat, oily fish or white fish showed weight changes up to -0.87 kg. Increasing the intake of unsaturated fatty acids at the expense of SFA, proteins, and carbohydrates showed beneficial effects on body weight and obesity.

Saturated fatty acid intake decreases serum adiponectin levels in subjects with type 1 diabetes.,Eccel Prates R; Beretta MV; Nascimento FV; Bernaud FR; de Almeira JC; Rodrigues TC,"BACKGROUND: Adiponectin is a protein secreted by adipose tissue. It plays a key role in insulin resistance and has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic functions. Changes in diet can influence adiponectin levels. Different dietary interventions, especially those altering fatty acid intake, have been reported as possible mediators of adiponectin levels. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 122 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Dietary intake was evaluated by 3-day weighed-diet records. Adiponectin levels were categorized into tertiles (T1, <10.260μg/mL; T2, 10.261-18.280μg/mL; T3, >18.281μg/mL). RESULTS: Mean age was 38±11years, and mean duration of diabetes was 17±9years. After multiple regression analysis, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r=-0.19, p = 0.03), age (r=-0.22, p=0.01), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (r=-0.27, p=0.002), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r=-0.19, p=0.30), total lipid intake (g) (r=-0.20, p=0.02), saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake (r=-0.25, p=0.004), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake (r=-0.21, p=0.02), cholesterol intake (mg) (r=-0.20, p=0.021), sodium intake (g) (r=-0.19, p=0.03), and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) (μg/24h) (r=0.26, p=0.02) correlated with adiponectin levels. Even after adjustment for age, SBP or DBP, UAE, and WHR in all models, inverse associations between adiponectin levels and intake of total SFA and MUFA and polyunsaturated fatty acid fractions were observed. Subjects in the first and third tertiles of adiponectin exhibited the greatest differences between adiponectin levels, with a trend toward increasing levels with higher SFA intake.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids and reduced odds of MCI: the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.,Roberts RO; Cerhan JR; Geda YE; Knopman DS; Cha RH; Christianson TJ; Pankratz VS; Ivnik RJ; O'Connor HM; Petersen RC,"Mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, PUFA) have been associated with a reduced risk of dementia. The association of these fatty acids with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is not fully established. The objective of the study was to investigate the cross-sectional association of dietary fatty acids with MCI in a population-based sample. Participants aged >or= 70 years on October 1, 2004, were evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (participant and informant), a neurological evaluation, and neuropsychological testing. A panel of nurses, physicians, and neuropsychologists reviewed the data for each participant in order to establish a diagnosis of MCI, normal cognition, or dementia by consensus. Participants also completed a 128-item food-frequency questionnaire. Among 1,233 non-demented subjects, 163 (13.2%) had MCI. The odds ratio (OR) of MCI decreased with increasing PUFA and MUFA intake.

"Effect of interaction between PPARG, PPARA and ADIPOQ gene variants and dietary fatty acids on plasma lipid profile and adiponectin concentration in a large intervention study.",AlSaleh A; Sanders TA; O'Dell SD,"Unsaturated fatty acids are ligands of PPAR-γ, which up-regulates genes involved in fatty acid transport and TAG synthesis and the insulin-sensitising adipokine adiponectin, which activates fatty acid β-oxidation via PPAR-α action in liver. We investigated the effect of dietary fatty acid interaction with PPARG, PPARA and ADIPOQ gene variants on plasma lipid and adiponectin concentrations in the Reading Imperial Surrey Cambridge King's study, a five-centre, parallel design, randomised controlled trial of 466 subjects at increased cardiometabolic risk. After a 4-week run-in to baseline, SFA was replaced by MUFA or carbohydrate (low fat) in isoenergetic diets for 24 weeks. Habitual dietary PUFA:SFA ratio×PPARG Pro12Ala genotype interaction influenced plasma total cholesterol (P=0·02), LDL-cholesterol (P=0·002) and TAG (P=0·02) concentrations in White subjects. PPARA Val162Leu×PPARG Pro12Ala genotype interaction influenced total cholesterol (P=0·04) and TAG (P=0·03) concentrations at baseline. After high-MUFA and low-fat diets, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were reduced (P<0·001) and gene×gene interaction determined LDL-cholesterol (P=0·003) and small dense LDL as a proportion of LDL (P=0·012). At baseline, ADIPOQ -10066 G/A A-allele was associated with lower serum adiponectin (n 360; P=0·03) in White subjects. After the high-MUFA diet, serum adiponectin increased in GG subjects and decreased in A-allele carriers (P=0·006 for difference). In GG, adiponectin increased with age after the high MUFA and decreased after the low-fat diet (P=0·003 for difference at 60 years). In conclusion, in Whites, high dietary PUFA:SFA would help to reduce plasma cholesterol and TAG in PPARG Ala12 carriers.

Measurement of dietary intake of fatty acids in pregnant women: comparison of self-reported intakes with adipose tissue levels.,Pinto E; Ramos E; Severo M; Casal S; Dos Santos Silva I; Lopes C; Barros H,"PURPOSE: Dietary fatty acids affect several pregnancy outcomes including fetal growth and development. We compared self-reported intakes with concentrations of fatty acids in adipose tissue in pregnant women. METHODS: The study was nested within Geração XXI, a birth cohort assembled in Portugal. Intake was assessed by nine food diaries (FDs) completed throughout pregnancy and an FFQ administered in the immediate postpartum period. A gluteal adipose tissue sample was obtained from 23 women. RESULTS: FDs and FFQ estimated similar percentages of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), but the adipose tissue yielded a lower percentage of SFA and higher percentages of MUFA and PUFA. Correlations between FDs and adipose tissue ranged from r = 0.50 for trans fatty acids to r = -0.19 for linolenic acid. The proportion of women categorized in opposite tertiles by these two methods ranged from 4.3% to 30.4%. Correlations between FFQ and adipose tissue were even weaker and levels of misclassification higher.

Influence of mutation in human apolipoprotein A-1 gene promoter on plasma LDL cholesterol response to dietary fat.,Lopez-Miranda J; Ordovas JM; Espino A; Marin C; Salas J; Lopez-Segura F; Jimenez-Pereperez J; Perez-Jimenez F,"The plasma lipid response to changes in dietary fat and cholesterol can vary between individuals. At present, responders cannot be identified in advance. An adenine to guanine (A-->G) mutation in the promoter of the apolipoprotein A1 gene (apoA-1) has been suggested as affecting plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In 50 young men we examined the effect of the same mutation on the responses of both high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-fat diet. The frequency for the A allele was 0.14. Subjects were fed a low-fat diet for 25 days, followed by a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA, 22% out of 40% fat) for 28 days and lipoproteins were measured at the end of each diet. There were no differences in initial total cholesterol between subjects with the G/G mutation (170 mg/dL: 100 mg/dL = 2.59 mmol/L) and the G/A mutation (169 mg/dL) genotypes.

Dietary habits are related to outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure awaiting heart transplantation.,Spaderna H; Zahn D; Pretsch J; Connor SL; Zittermann A; Schulze Schleithoff S; Bramstedt KA; Smits JM; Weidner G,"BACKGROUND: Empirical evidence supporting the benefits of dietary recommendations for patients with advanced heart failure is scarce. We prospectively evaluated the relation of dietary habits to pre-transplant clinical outcomes in the multisite observational Waiting for a New Heart Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 318 heart transplant candidates (82% male, age 53 ± 11 years) completed a Food Frequency Questionnaire (foods high in salt, saturated fats, poly-/monounsaturated fats [PUFA+MUFA], fruit/vegetables/legumes, and fluid intake) at time of waitlisting. Cox proportional hazard models controlling for heart failure severity (eg, Heart Failure Survival Score, creatinine) estimated cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) associated with each dietary habit individually, and with all dietary habits entered simultaneously. During follow-up (median 338 days, range 13-1,394), 54 patients died, 151 received transplants (110 in high-urgency status, 41 electively), and 45 became delisted (15 deteriorated, 30 improved). Two robust findings emerged: Frequent intake of salty foods, which correlated positively with saturated fat and fluid intake, was associated with transplantation in high-urgency status (HR 2.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-5.42); and frequent intake of foods rich in PUFA+MUFA reduced the risk for death/deterioration (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.92).

The second and third diets were administered according to a randomized crossover design, and they consisted of a low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet (CHO diet; 28% of energy from fat and <10% of energy from SFAs) and a high-monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diet (called the Mediterranean diet; 38% of energy from fat and 22% of energy from MUFAs). All food and drinks were prepared and provided in the research kitchen. We determined in vivo insulin resistance by using the insulin suppression test with somatostatin. RESULTS: Steady state plasma glucose concentrations were significantly higher in Ala54Thr subjects after the SFA diet than after the CHO diet or the Mediterranean diet. The plasma free fatty acid concentrations in these subjects were significantly lower after the CHO and Mediterranean diets than after the SFA diet. However, no significant differences between the 3 diets were observed in the Ala54 allele homozygotes. CONCLUSION: Insulin sensitivity decreased in subjects with the Thr54 allele of the FABP2 polymorphism when SFAs were replaced by MUFAs and carbohydrates.",2005,Jul,Am J Clin Nutr,82,1,196-200,,10.1093/ajcn.82.1.196,16002819,#8666,Marín 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The effect of apolipoprotein B xbaI polymorphism on plasma lipid response to dietary fat.,López-Miranda J; Marín C; Castro P; Gómez P; González-Amieva A; Paz E; Bravo D; Ordovas JM; Jimenez-Pereperez J; Pérez-Jiménez F,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lipid response to dietary fat and cholesterol is, to a large extent, genetically controlled. Apolipoprotein B (apo B) plays a dominant role in cholesterol homeostasis. Several polymorphic sites within or adjacent to the gene locus for apo B have been detected. The X+ allele of the XbaI restriction fragment polymorphism of the apo B gene has been found to be associated with higher serum cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels. In order to study the influence of this mutation on the plasma lipid response in diets of varying fat content, 72 healthy male subjects were studied, 21 X- X- (X-) and 51 X+ (X+ X- or X+ X+). METHODS AND RESULTS: These subjects followed three consecutive 28-day diet periods: one rich in saturated fats (SAT diet; 38% fat, 20% saturated); a National Cholesterol Education Program type I diet (NCEP-I diet) (28% fats, < 10% saturated); and a third monounsaturated (MUFA diet) (38% fats, 22% monounsaturated). The different genotypes can be observed to have significant effects on total and LDL cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.017). X+ individuals had higher levels of total and LDL cholesterol after the consumption of a SAT diet (P < 0.012; P < 0.006, respectively), NCEP diet (P < 0.060; P < 0.054, respectively) and MUFA diet (P < 0.022; P < 0.042, respectively) in comparison with X- individuals. A significant interaction between genotypes and dietary effects was observed for diet-induced changes in plasma triglycerides (P < 0.032). Significant decreases in the absolute values of triglyceride concentrations (-0.18 mmol L(-1), P < 0.024) were noted in the X- subjects after the high intake of a MUFA diet, while no significant differences were observed in the X+ individuals (0.006 mmol L(-1), P < 0.858). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the total triglyceride response to diet is influenced by the apo B XbaI polymorphism.",2000,Aug,Eur J Clin Invest,30,8,678-84,,10.1046/j.1365-2362.2000.00681.x,10964159,#8671,López-Miranda 2000,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Genetic Variants in Lipid Metabolism Pathways Interact with Diet to Influence Blood Lipid Concentrations in Adults with Overweight and Obesity.,Hannon BA; Edwards CG; Thompson SV; Burke SK; Burd NA; Holscher HD; Teran-Garcia M; Khan NA,"INTRODUCTION: The effect of various types of dietary fat on cardiometabolic health continues to be debated, due in part to the high heterogeneity of results following clinical trials investigating the effects of saturated (SFA) and unsaturated fat intake. This variability may be due to genetic differences. Individuals with obesity are at an increased risk for adverse cardiometabolic health and dyslipidemia, and often present with the combined phenotype of elevated triglyceride (TG) and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. Studying genetic variants relevant to lipid and lipoprotein metabolism can elucidate the mechanisms by which diet might interact with genotype to influence these phenotypes. The objective of this study was to determine relationships of genetic variation, dietary fat intake, and blood lipid concentrations in adults with overweight and obesity. METHODS: Genomic DNA, blood lipid concentrations (HDL and TG), and 7-day diet records were obtained from 101 adults (25-45 years of age) with overweight or obesity. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured using indirect calorimetry and used to determine implausible intakes using a modified Goldberg method (kilocalories/REE). Genetic variants included 23 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 15 genes in lipid metabolism pathways. Variants were analyzed with dietary fat intake (total fat, SFA, monounsaturated fat [MUFA], and polyunsaturated fat [PUFA]) via regression analyses. All models were adjusted for age, sex, ancestry, visceral adipose tissue mass, and total kilocalorie intake. The Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Two interactions were detected for TG concentrations. Five gene-diet interactions were associated with HDL concentrations. There was a significant interaction detected between the rs5882 variant of cholesterol-esterase transfer protein (CETP) and MUFA intake to associate with TG concentrations (interaction p = 0.004, R2 = 0.306). Among carriers of the CETP-rs5882 major allele (G), TG concentrations were significantly lower in individuals consuming more than the median MUFA intake (31 g/day) than in those with an intake below the median. Total dietary fat intake interacted with the rs13702 polymorphism of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to associate with HDL concentrations (interaction p = 0.041, R2 = 0.419), by which individuals with the risk allele (G) had significantly higher HDL concentrations when consuming a higher-fat diet (>92 g/day) than those with a lower-fat diet (56 ± 3 vs. 46 ± 2 mg/dL, p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between dietary intake and genes in lipid metabolism pathways were found to be associated with blood lipid concentrations in adults with overweight and obesity. Fatty acid intake may not modulate blood lipid concentrations uniformly across all individuals. Additional research is needed to determine the biological causes of individual variability in response to dietary intake. Understanding the influence of nutrigenetic interactions on dyslipidemia can aid in the development and implementation of personalized dietary strategies to improve health.",2020,,Lifestyle Genom,13,6,155-163,,10.1159/000507021,33105144,#8677,Hannon 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Dietary intakes and food sources of fatty acids for Belgian women, focused on n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",Sioen IA; Pynaert I; Matthys C; De Backer G; Van Camp J; De Henauw S,"The intake of fat, saturated and monounsaturated FA (SFA and MUFA), and omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA has been estimated in 641 Belgian women (age 18-39 y). Their food intake was recorded using a 2-d food diary. The PUFA included were linoleic (LA), alpha-linolenic (LNA), arachidonic (AA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. The mean total fat intake corresponded to 34.3% of total energy intake (E). The mean intake of the FA groups corresponded to 13.7%, 13.1%, and 6.0% of E, for SFA, MUFA, and PUFA, respectively. The mean intake of LA was 5.3% of E and of LNA was 0.6% of E, with a mean LA/LNA ratio of 8.7. The mean intake of AA was 0.03% of E. The mean intake of EPA, DPA, and DHA was 0.04%, 0.01%, and 0.06% of E, respectively. According to the Belgian recommendations, the total fat and SFA intake was too high for about three-quarters of the population. The mean LA and overall n-6 PUFA intake corresponded with the recommendation, with part of the population exceeding the upper level. Conversely, the population showed a large deficit for LNA and n-3 PUFA. The major food source for LA and LNA was fats and oils, followed by cereal products. The main sources of long-chain PUFA were fish and seafood, and meat, poultry, and eggs. From a public health perspective, it seems desirable to tackle the problem of low n-3 PUFA intake.",2006,May,Lipids,41,5,415-22,,10.1007/s11745-006-5115-5,16933786,#8703,Sioen 2006,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fat differentially modulate the mRNA expression levels of oxidative mitochondrial genes in skeletal muscle of healthy subjects.,Turco AA; Guescini M; Valtucci V; Colosimo C; De Feo P; Mantuano M; Stocchi V; Riccardi G; Capaldo B,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Different types of dietary fats exert differential effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of different dietary fats on the expression of skeletal muscle genes regulating mitochondrial replication and function in healthy subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten healthy subjects (age 29 ± 3 years; BMI 25.0 ± 3 kg/m(2)) received in a random order a test meal with the same energy content but different composition in macronutrients and quality of fat: Mediterranean (MED) meal, SAFA meal (Lipid 66%, saturated 36%) and MUFA meal (Lipid 63%, monounsaturated 37%). At fast and after 180 min, a fine needle aspiration was performed from the vastus lateralis for determination of mitochondrial gene expression by quantitative PCR. No difference in glucose and triglyceride response was observed between the three meals, while NEFA levels were significantly higher following fat-rich meals compared to MED meal (p < 0.002-0.0001). MED meal was associated with an increased expression, albeit not statistically significant, of some genes regulating both replication and function. Following MUFA meal, a significant increase in the expression of PGC1β (p = 0.02) and a reduction in the transcription factor PPARδ (p = 0.006) occurred with no change in the expression of COX and GLUT4 genes. In contrast, SAFA meal was associated with a marked reduction in the expression of COX (p < 0.001) PFK (p < 0.003), LPL (p = 0.002) and GLUT4 (p = 0.009) genes.

Influence of the SstI polymorphism at the apolipoprotein C-III gene locus on the plasma low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol response to dietary monounsaturated fat.,López-Miranda J; Jansen S; Ordovas JM; Salas J; Marín C; Castro P; Ostos MA; Cruz G; López-Segura F; Blanco A; Jiménez-Perepérez J; Pérez-Jiménez F,"The plasma lipid response to changes in dietary fat and cholesterol can vary between individuals. The SstI polymorphism, arising from a cytosine to guanosine substitution in the 3' untranslated region of the APOC3 gene distinguishes between two alleles--S1 and S2. The S2 allele has been associated with elevated plasma triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) C-III concentrations. In 90 young men we examined the effect of the same mutation on the response of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to dietary monounsaturated fat. The frequency for the S2 allele was 0.14. Subjects were fed a low-fat diet for 25 d, followed by a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acid (22% MUFA, 38% total fat) for 28 d; lipoproteins were measured at the end of each diet. There were no significant differences in initial total cholesterol between subjects with the APOC3*S1/APOC3*S1 (S1/S1) and APOC3*S1/APOC3*S2 (S1/S2) genotypes. After consumption of the diet high in MUFA, significant increases in LDL cholesterol (0.13 mmol/L, P < 0.027) were noted in the S1/S1 subjects whereas a significant decrease was observed in the S1/S2 subjects (-0.18 mmol/L, P < 0.046). Significant genotypic effects were seen for diet-induced changes in LDL cholesterol (P < 0.00034), total cholesterol (P < 0.009), and apo B (P < 0.0014). A study of the effect of the interaction between this mutation with that present in position -76 of the APOA1 gene promoter region (G/A) revealed that both mutations had an additive effect on changes in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apo B induced by diets.

Gene-nutrient interactions and gender may modulate the association between ApoA1 and ApoB gene polymorphisms and metabolic syndrome risk.,Phillips CM; Goumidi L; Bertrais S; Field MR; McManus R; Hercberg S; Lairon D; Planells R; Roche HM,"OBJECTIVE: Dyslipidemia is a key feature of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is determined by both genetic and dietary factors. METHODS: We determined the relationships between ApoA1 and ApoB polymorphisms and MetS risk, and whether dietary fat modulates this in the LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX study of MetS cases and matched controls (n = 1754). RESULTS: ApoB rs512535 and ApoA1 rs670 major G allele homozygotes had increased MetS risk (OR 1.65 [CI 1.24, 2.20], P = 0.0006; OR 1.42 [CI 1.08, 1.87], P = 0.013), which may be, partly, explained by their increased abdominal obesity and impaired insulin sensitivity (P<0.05) but not dyslipidemia. Interestingly these associations derived primarily from the male GG homozygotes (ApoB rs512535 OR 1.92 [CI 1.31, 2.81], P = 0.0008; ApoA1 rs670 OR 1.50 [CI 1.05, 2.12], P = 0.024).

In addition a high monounsaturated fat (MUFA) intake (>14% energy) increased MetS risk (OR 1.89 [CI 1.08, 3.30], P = 0.026 and OR 1.57 [CI 1.10, 2.40], P = 0.014 for ApoB rs512535 and ApoA1 rs670, respectively). MetS risk was abolished among the habitual low-fat consumers (<35% energy). Saturated and polyunsaturated fat intake did not modulate MetS risk.

Beneficial effect of CETP gene polymorphism in combination with a Mediterranean diet influencing lipid metabolism in metabolic syndrome patients: CORDIOPREV study.,Garcia-Rios A; Alcala-Diaz JF; Gomez-Delgado F; Delgado-Lista J; Marin C; Leon-Acuña A; Camargo A; Rodriguez-Cantalejo F; Blanco-Rojo R; Quintana-Navarro G; Ordovas JM; Perez-Jimenez F; Lopez-Miranda J; Perez-Martinez P,"The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene has been implicated in high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) metabolism. However, little is known about the impact of this gene on metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients and its interaction with diet. Here, we evaluate whether the consumption of a Mediterranean diet, compared with a Low-fat diet, interacts with the rs3764261 SNP at the CETP locus to modify lipid metabolism in MetS patients. Plasma lipid concentrations and rs3764261 genotypes were determined in 424 MetS subjects participating in the CORDIOPREV clinical trial (NCT00924937). Gene-diet interactions were analyzed after a year of dietary intervention (Mediterranean diet (35% fat, 22% MUFA) vs Low-fat diet (28% fat, 12% MUFA)). We found significant gene-diet interactions between rs3764261 SNP and the dietary pattern for HDL-C (P = 0.006) and triglyceride concentrations (P = 0.040). Specifically, after 12 months of Mediterranean diet intervention, subjects who were carriers of the minor T allele (TT + TG) displayed higher plasma HDL-C concentrations (P = 0.021) and lower triglycerides (P = 0.020) compared with those who were homozygous for the major allele (GG). In contrast, in the Low-fat intervention group, no significant differences were found between CETP genotypes after 12 months of dietary treatment. Our data support the notion that the consumption of a Mediterranean diet may play a contributing role in triggering lipid metabolism by interacting with the rs3764261 SNP at CETP gene locus in MetS patients.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated fat type and amount on the primary outcomes: factor VIIc, fibrinogen, and PAI-1. METHODS: In the Dietary Effects on Lipoproteins and Thrombogenic Activity (DELTA) Trial, 2 controlled crossover feeding studies evaluated substituting carbohydrate or MUFAs for SFAs. Study 1: healthy participants (n = 103) were provided with (8 wk) an average American diet [AAD; designed to provide 37% of energy (%E) as fat, 16% SFA], a Step 1 diet (30%E fat, 9% SFA), and a diet low in SFA (Low-Sat; 26%E fat, 5% SFA). Study 2: participants (n = 85) at risk for CVD and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) were provided with (7 wk) an AAD, a step 1 diet, and a high-MUFA diet (designed to provide 37%E fat, 8% SFA, 22% MUFA). RESULTS: Study 1: compared with AAD, the Step 1 and Low-Sat diets decreased mean factor VIIc by 1.8% and 2.6% (overall P = 0.0001), increased mean fibrinogen by 1.2% and 2.8% (P = 0.0141), and increased mean square root PAI-1 by 0.0% and 6.0% (P = 0.0037), respectively. Study 2: compared with AAD, the Step 1 and high-MUFA diets decreased mean factor VIIc by 4.1% and 3.2% (overall P < 0.0001), increased mean fibrinogen by 3.9% and 1.5% (P = 0.0083), and increased mean square-root PAI-1 by 2.0% and 5.8% (P = 0.1319), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Replacing SFA with carbohydrate decreased factor VIIc and increased fibrinogen in healthy and metabolically unhealthy individuals and also increased PAI-1 in healthy subjects. Replacing SFA with MUFA decreased factor VIIc and increased fibrinogen but less than carbohydrate. Our results indicate an uncertain effect of replacing SFA with carbohydrate or MUFA on cardiometabolic risk because of small changes in hemostatic factors and directionally different responses to decreasing SFA.

We investigated whether obesity classification by BMI and body fat percentage (BF%) influences cardiometabolic profile and dietary responsiveness in 486 MetS subjects (LIPGENE dietary intervention study). DESIGN AND METHODS: Anthropometric measures, markers of inflammation and glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, adhesion molecules, and hemostatic factors were determined at baseline and after 12 weeks of four dietary interventions (high saturated fat (SFA), high monounsaturated fat (MUFA), and two low fat high complex carbohydrate (LFHCC) diets, one supplemented with long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs)). RESULTS: About 39 and 87% of subjects classified as normal and overweight by BMI were obese according to their BF%. Individuals classified as obese by BMI (≥ 30 kg/m(2)) and BF% (≥ 25% (men) and ≥ 35% (women)) (OO, n = 284) had larger waist and hip measurements, higher BMI and were heavier (P < 0.001) than those classified as nonobese by BMI but obese by BF% (NOO, n = 92).

"Replacement of dietary saturated fat with unsaturated fats increases numbers of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and decreases numbers of microparticles: findings from the randomized, controlled Dietary Intervention and VAScular function (DIVAS) s",Weech M; Altowaijri H; Mayneris-Perxachs J; Vafeiadou K; Madden J; Todd S; Jackson KG; Lovegrove JA; Yaqoob P,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and microparticles are emerging as novel markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, which could potentially be modified by dietary fat. We have previously shown that replacing dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with monounsaturated or n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs or PUFAs, respectively) improved lipid biomarkers, blood pressure, and markers of endothelial activation, but their effects on circulating EPCs and microparticles are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The Dietary Intervention and VAScular function (DIVAS) Study investigated the replacement of 9.5-9.6% of total energy (%TE) contributed by SFAs with MUFAs or n-6 PUFAs for 16 wk on EPC and microparticle numbers in United Kingdom adults with moderate CVD risk. DESIGN: In this randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group dietary intervention, men and women aged 21-60 y (n = 190) with moderate CVD risk (≥50% above the population mean) consumed 1 of three 16-wk isoenergetic diets. Target compositions for total fat, SFAs, MUFAs, and n-6 PUFAs (%TE) were as follows: SFA-rich diet (36:17:11:4; n = 64), MUFA-rich diet (36:9:19:4; n = 62), and n-6 PUFA-rich diet (36:9:13:10; n = 66). Circulating EPC, endothelial microparticle (EMP), and platelet microparticle (PMP) numbers were analyzed by flow cytometry. Dietary intake, vascular function, and other cardiometabolic risk factors were determined at baseline. RESULTS: Relative to the SFA-rich diet, MUFA- and n-6 PUFA-rich diets decreased EMP (-47.3%, -44.9%) respectively and PMP (-36.8%, -39.1%) numbers (overall diet effects, P < 0.01). The MUFA-rich diet increased EPC numbers (+28.4%; P = 0.023). Additional analyses that used stepwise regression models identified the augmentation index (measuring arterial stiffness determined by pulse-wave analysis) as an independent predictor of baseline EPC and microparticle numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Replacement of 9.5-9.6%TE dietary SFAs with MUFAs increased EPC numbers, and replacement with either MUFAs or n-6 PUFAs decreased microparticle numbers, suggesting beneficial effects on endothelial repair and maintenance. Further studies are warranted to determine the mechanisms underlying the favorable effects on EPC and microparticle numbers after SFA replacement.

Infancy-onset dietary counseling of low-saturated-fat diet improves insulin sensitivity in healthy adolescents 15-20 years of age: the Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project (STRIP) study.,Oranta O; Pahkala K; Ruottinen S; Niinikoski H; Lagström H; Viikari JS; Jula A; Loo BM; Simell O; Rönnemaa T; Raitakari OT,"OBJECTIVE: We reported previously that low-saturated-fat dietary counseling started in infancy improves insulin sensitivity in healthy children 9 years of age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lifelong dietary counseling on insulin sensitivity in healthy adolescents between 15 and 20 years of age. In addition, we examined dietary fiber intake and the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)+monounsaturated (MUFA)-to-saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio in the intervention and control adolescents and the association of these dietary factors with homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study comprised adolescents participating in the randomized, controlled Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project (STRIP) study, which aims to guide the study participants toward a diet beneficial for cardiovascular health. HOMA-IR was assessed annually between 15 and 20 years of age (n=518; intervention, n=245; control, n=273), along with diet, BMI, pubertal status, serum cotinine concentrations, and physical activity. Dietary counseling was given biannually during the follow-up. RESULTS: HOMA-IR was lower (7.5% on average) in the intervention group than in the control group between 15 and 20 years of age (P=0.0051). The intervention effect was similar in girls and boys. The PUFA+MUFA-to-SFA ratio was higher (P<0.0001) and the dietary fiber (g/MJ) intake was higher (P=0.0058) in the intervention group compared with the control group. There was no association between the PUFA+MUFA-to-/SFA ratio and HOMA-IR, whereas dietary fiber intake (g/MJ) was associated with HOMA-IR in girls (P<0.0001).

Differences in diet and food habits between patients with gallstones and controls.,Ortega RM; Fernández-Azuela M; Encinas-Sotillos A; Andrés P; López-Sobaler AM,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the food, energy, macronutrient and micronutrient intake of patients with gallstones to those of a control group of similar demographic characteristics. DESIGN: Patient-control study. SUBJECTS: 54 gallstone patients and 46 control subjects. METHODS: Two 24-hour dietary recalls and a ""food frequency intake"" questionnaire were obtained from patients and controls. In both groups, the presence/absence of gallstones was confirmed by ultrasonography. Participants answered a questionnaire on their physical activity patterns. RESULTS: Gallstone patients consumed less food per day (g/day) and less fish and fruits than did control subjects. They also showed greater intakes of cereals, oils, sugars and meats than did control subjects and ate fewer meals per day, tending to omit evening snacks and more substantial evening meals. Further, patients spent less time walking and slept more than did control subjects. They also experienced fluctuations in body weight with greater frequency. Patients consumed more total calories (energy) and fats (especially monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids), and less fiber, folate and magnesium than did control subjects. Women with gallstones were shown to have significantly higher intakes of total fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, and significantly lower intakes of fiber, folate, magnesium, calcium and vitamin C than control women. For all vitamins and minerals studied, patients showed a greater percentage of intakes below those recommended.

"Dietary energy density, metabolic parameters, and blood pressure in a sample of adults with obesity.",Pour-Abbasi MS; Nikrad N; Farhangi MA; Vahdat S; Jafarzadeh F,"BACKGROUND: Several previous studies revealed the role of dietary energy density (DED) in developing obesity and related disorders. However, the possible role of DED in triggering cardiometabolic risk factors of individuals with obesity has not been studied yet. This study aimed to evaluate the association between DED and anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, and components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) (such as glycemic markers, lipid profile, and blood pressure) among individuals with obesity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 335 adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) aged 20-50 years in Tabriz and Tehran, Iran. Dietary intake was assessed by a validated semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), including 168 food items; then, DED was calculated. MetS was defined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III). Enzymatic methods were used to assess serum lipids, glucose, and insulin concentrations. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometer and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). RESULTS: Participants in the higher tertiles of DED had more intake of carbohydrate, dietary fat, saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and meat, fish, poultry (MFP). Increasing the DED in both methods had no association with systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting blood sugar (FBS), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), insulin, triglyceride (TG), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) even after adjustment for confounders. However, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased in second tertile of DED I (β = 0.921, P = 0.004). The quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) in second tertile of both DED methods had significant positive association with DED. In the second tertile of DED II, while total cholesterol (TC) significantly decreased (P crude = 0.036, P adjusted = 0.024), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased (β = 1.096, p = 0.03). There was no significant changes in biochemical parameters in third tertile of DED I and II even after adjustment for covariates. Also, higher tertiles of DED was associated with reduced prevalence of MetS. CONCLUSION: High DED was associated with lower levels of blood pressure and TC but elevated levels of HDL and QUICKI independent of such confounders as age, BMI, sex, and physical activity. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to better elucidate casual associations.",2023,Jan,BMC Endocr Disord,23,1,3,,10.1186/s12902-022-01243-9,36600237,#8848,Pour-Abbasi 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Fecal Bacteria as Biomarkers for Predicting Food Intake in Healthy Adults.,Shinn LM; Li Y; Mansharamani A; Auvil LS; Welge ME; Bushell C; Khan NA; Charron CS; Novotny JA; Baer DJ; Zhu R; Holscher HD,"BACKGROUND: Diet affects the human gastrointestinal microbiota. Blood and urine samples have been used to determine nutritional biomarkers. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the utility of fecal biomarkers, including microbes, as biomarkers of food intake. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify a compact set of fecal microbial biomarkers of food intake with high predictive accuracy. METHODS: Data were aggregated from 5 controlled feeding studies in metabolically healthy adults (n = 285; 21-75 y; BMI 19-59 kg/m2; 340 data observations) that studied the impact of specific foods (almonds, avocados, broccoli, walnuts, and whole-grain barley and whole-grain oats) on the human gastrointestinal microbiota. Fecal DNA was sequenced using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Marginal screening was performed on all species-level taxa to examine the differences between the 6 foods and their respective controls. The top 20 species were selected and pooled together to predict study food consumption using a random forest model and out-of-bag estimation. The number of taxa was further decreased based on variable importance scores to determine the most compact, yet accurate feature set. RESULTS: Using the change in relative abundance of the 22 taxa remaining after feature selection, the overall model classification accuracy of all 6 foods was 70%. Collapsing barley and oats into 1 grains category increased the model accuracy to 77% with 23 unique taxa. Overall model accuracy was 85% using 15 unique taxa when classifying almonds (76% accurate), avocados (88% accurate), walnuts (72% accurate), and whole grains (96% accurate). Additional statistical validation was conducted to confirm that the model was predictive of specific food intake and not the studies themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Food consumption by healthy adults can be predicted using fecal bacteria as biomarkers. The fecal microbiota may provide useful fidelity measures to ascertain nutrition study compliance.",2021,Feb,J Nutr,151,2,423-433,,10.1093/jn/nxaa285,33021315,#8851,Shinn 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study type; ,Maybe
Association of Dietary Fatty Acids with Blood Lipids is Modified by Physical Activity in Adolescents: Results from the GINIplus and LISA Birth Cohort Studies.,Harris CP; von Berg A; Berdel D; Bauer CP; Schikowski T; Koletzko S; Heinrich J; Schulz H; Standl M,"The role of consuming different types of fatty acids (FA) at the expense of carbohydrates (CHO), on the blood lipid profile of adolescents is largely unknown, as is the modulating effect of different levels of physical activity (PA). Children from the GINIplus and LISA birth cohorts, with complete data on dietary FA (assessed by food-frequency questionnaires), objectively-measured PA (assessed by accelerometers) and blood lipids (lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides) at age 15 years, were included (N = 837). Sex-stratified associations between dietary FA and blood lipids were assessed by linear regression in substitution models which represented isocaloric replacements of CHO with saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), n-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) or n-6 PUFA. To assess the interactions with PA, analyses were then performed stratified by tertiles of different PA levels (sedentary, lifestyle, moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA)). Both sexes presented a significant inverse association between MUFA and triglycerides, and females a direct association between n-3 PUFA and high-density lipoprotein. Stratifying by PA tertiles, associations were mainly restricted to participants with the lowest levels of lifestyle PA, or the highest time spent sedentary. The effects of dietary FA on the lipid profile vary in an activity-specific manner, emphasizing possible synergistic roles of diet and PA.",2018,Sep,Nutrients,10,10,,,10.3390/nu10101372,30257483,#8888,Harris 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Higher baseline dietary fat and fatty acid intake is associated with increased risk of incident prostate cancer in the SABOR study.,Liss MA; Al-Bayati O; Gelfond J; Goros M; Ullevig S; DiGiovanni J; Hamilton-Reeves J; O'Keefe D; Bacich D; Weaver B; Leach R; Thompson IM,"BACKGROUND: To study the association of nutrient intake measured by baseline food frequency questionnaire and risk of subsequent prostate cancer (PCa) in the SABOR (San Antonio Biomarkers of Risk) cohort study. METHODS: After IRB approval, more than 1903 men enrolled in a prospective cohort from 2000 to 2010 as part of the SABOR clinical validation site for the National Cancer Institute Early Detection Research Network. Food and nutrient intakes were calculated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards modeling and covariate-balanced propensity scores were used to assess the associations between all nutrients and PCa. RESULTS: A total of 229 men were diagnosed with PCa by prostate biopsy. Among all nutrients, increased risk of PCa was associated with intake of dietary fat scaled by the total caloric intake, particularly saturated fatty acid (SFA) [HR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.32), P value < 0.001, False discovery rate (FDR) 0.047] and trans fatty acid (TFA) [HR per quintile 1.21; (95% CI) (1.08-1.35), P < 0.001, FDR 0.039]. There was an increased risk of PCa with increasing intake of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (HR per quintile 1.14; 95% CI 1.03-1.27, P = 0.01, FDR 0.15) and cholesterol [HR per quintile 1.13; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (1.02-1.26), P-value 0.02, FDR 0.19]. CONCLUSION: After examining a large, population-based cohort for PCa diagnosis, we identified dietary total fat and certain fatty acids as associated with increased risk of PCa. We found no factors that were protective from PCa.

"Consuming a balanced high fat diet for 16 weeks improves body composition, inflammation and vascular function parameters in obese premenopausal women.",Silver HJ; Kang H; Keil CD; Muldowney JA 3rd; Kocalis H; Fazio S; Vaughan DE; Niswender KD,"OBJECTIVE: Inflammation, insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction characterize obesity and predict development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although women experience CVD events at an older age, vascular dysfunction is evident 10years prior to coronary artery disease. Questions remain whether replacing SFA entirely with MUFA or PUFA is the optimal approach for cardiometabolic benefits. This study tested the hypotheses that: a) body composition, inflammation and vascular function would improve with a high fat diet (HFD) when type of fat is balanced as 1/3 SFA, 1/3 MUFA and 1/3 PUFA; and b) body composition, inflammation and vascular function would improve more when balanced HFD is supplemented with 18C fatty acids, in proportion to the degree of 18C unsaturation. METHODS: Obese premenopausal women were stabilized on balanced HFD and randomized to consume 9g/d of encapsulated stearate (18:0), oleate (18:1), linoleate (18:2) or placebo. RESULTS: Significant improvements occurred in fat oxidation rate (↑6%), body composition (%fat: ↓2.5±2.1%; %lean: ↑2.5±2.1%), inflammation (↓ IL-1α, IL-1β, 1L-12, Il-17, IFNγ, TNFα, TNFβ) and vascular function (↓BP, ↓PAI-1, ↑tPA activity). When compared to HFD+placebo, HFD+stearate had the greatest effect on reducing IFNγ (↓74%) and HFD+linoleate had the greatest effect on reducing PAI-1 (↓31%). CONCLUSIONS: Balancing the type of dietary fat consumed (SFA/MUFA/PUFA) is a feasible strategy to positively affect markers of CVD risk. Moreover, reductions in inflammatory molecules involved in vascular function might be enhanced when intake of certain 18C fatty acids is supplemented. Long term effects need to be determined for this approach.",2014,Apr,Metabolism,63,4,562-73,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00696228,10.1016/j.metabol.2014.01.004,24559846,#8918,Silver 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Manipulation of fatty acid composition in a high-fat meal does not result in differential alterations in appetite or food intake in normal weight females: A single-blind randomized crossover study.,Graybeal AJ; Meena Shah; Willis JL,"A behavioral concept that generates a path to obesity is eating in the absence of hunger (EAH). One strategy that may be effective in preventing EAH is the manipulation of dietary fatty acid (FA) composition. However, it remains unclear which FA has the greatest impact on both appetite and EAH. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of different dietary FA compositions (monounsaturated, MUFA; polyunsaturated, PUFA; saturated, SFA) on subjective ratings of appetite and subsequent ad libitum eating after a 3 h postprandial period. Sixteen apparently healthy normal weight females between ages 18-40 completed this randomized, single-blind, crossover study. Participants consumed a HF meal (65% energy from fat) rich in SFA, MUFA, and PUFA with an energy content corresponding to 35% of their measured resting metabolic rate on three separate occasions. Visual analog scales were collected while fasted and every 30 min for 3 h during a postprandial period to measure feelings of hunger, fullness, and desire to eat (DTE). Participants were provided an ad libitum buffet meal 3 h after the HF meal. There were no statistically significant differences for ratings of hunger, fullness, or DTE across conditions. Further, there was no significant difference in energy intake during the ad libitum lunch. We conclude that the manipulation of FA composition in a HF meal does not differentially affect appetite sensations or subsequent energy intake.",2021,May,Appetite,160,,105085,,10.1016/j.appet.2020.105085,33387588,#8929,Graybeal 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary Fats and All-cause and Breast Cancer-specific Mortality among Women with Breast Cancer: The Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer Study.,Meyer DS; Millen AE; Nie J; Trevisan M; Freudenheim JL,"BACKGROUND: Study results of prediagnostic dietary fat intake and breast cancer mortality have been inconclusive. While dietary fat subtypes [saturated (SFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA), and monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids] may have different biological effects, there is little evidence regarding the association of dietary fat and fat subtype intake with mortality after breast cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Women with incident, pathologically confirmed invasive breast cancer and complete dietary data (n = 793) were followed in a population-based study, the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer study. Usual intake before diagnosis of total fat and subtypes were estimated from a food frequency questionnaire completed at baseline. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models. Interactions by menopausal status, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and tumor stage were examined. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 18.75 years; 327 (41.2%) participants had died. Compared with lower intake, greater intake of total fat (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.65-1.70), SFA (1.31; 0.82-2.10), MUFA (0.99; 0.61-1.60), and PUFA (0.99; 0.56-1.75) was not associated with breast cancer-specific mortality. There was also no association with all-cause mortality. Results did not vary by menopausal status, ER status, or tumor stage. CONCLUSIONS: Prediagnostic intake of dietary fat and fat subtypes was not associated with either all-cause or breast cancer mortality in a population-based cohort of breast cancer survivors. IMPACT: Understanding factors affecting survival among women diagnosed with breast cancer is critically important. Dietary fat intake prior to diagnosis may not impact that survival.",2023,Jun,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,32,6,854-856,,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-22-0881,36996389,#8945,Meyer 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary Fat Intake among Chinese Adults and Their Relationships with Blood Lipids: Findings from China Nutrition and Health Surveillance and Comparison with the PURE Study.,Zhao R; Zhao L; Yang F; Ju L; Li S; Cheng X; Xu X; Guo Q; Cai S; Fang H; Yu D; Ding G,"Dietary fat intake in the Chinese population has increased. The PURE (prospective urban rural epidemiology) study concluded the potential advantage of total fat and saturated fats (SFA) over carbohydrates on blood lipids with the inaccurate assessment of dietary fats. We investigated the dietary fat profile among 48,315 participants (aged 30−70 years, national representative) from the China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (2015−2017), determined the relationship of various fats with blood lipid biomarkers in the selected 39,115 participants, and compared the results with the PURE study. Dietary fat intake was calculated by using 3 days of 24 h recalls and food inventory. Serum lipid biomarkers were assessed at morning fasting state by health professionals. Plant fats (21.5% of total energy (TE)) dominated in total fat intake (69.5 g/day, 35.6% TE), with monounsaturated fats (MUFA) in the largest (13.8% TE) portion and plant oils as the major source (43.7%). Two thirds of the population consumed more than 30% TE from dietary fats and nearly half more than 35%, while 26.4% of them exceeded 10% TE from SFA. Total fat was positively associated with total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), but also high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and negatively with triglyceride (TG)-to-HDL-c ratio (TGHDL) (all p-trend < 0.05). Replacing total fat with carbohydrate yielded adverse changes in most biomarkers (higher LDL-c, TG, and TGHDL, lower HDL-c, all p < 0.05) when total fat was low (<34.9% TE). Regardless of fat intake level, replacing plant fat or polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) with carbohydrate yielded the most adverse changes (higher TC, LDL-c, TG, TC-to-HDL-c ratio (TCHDL), and TGHDL, but lower HDL-c, all p < 0.01), while replacing animal fat/SFA with plant fat/PUFA yielded the most favorable changes (lower all biomarkers, all p < 0.01). The results suggested a less harmful effect of carbohydrate on blood lipids when total fat was high, and more beneficial effect of unsaturated fats, than the PURE. In conclusion, dietary fat intake in Chinese adults had reached quite a high level, but with a different profile from Western populations. Replacement of SFA (animal fat) with PUFA (plant fat) could most effectively improve blood lipids, while replacement with carbohydrate could slightly benefit only when total fat was high. The present results may be more applicable to the Chinese population than the PURE study.",2022,Dec,Nutrients,14,24,,,10.3390/nu14245262,36558420,#8951,Zhao 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Nutritional status of women with gestational hypertension compared with normal pregnant women.,Kazemian E; Dorosty-Motlagh AR; Sotoudeh G; Eshraghian MR; Ansary S; Omidian M,"BACKGROUND: Some evidence indicated the role of nutrition in the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted on 113 women with gestational hypertension and 150 healthy pregnant women referred to Shahid Akbarabadi Hospital in Tehran. A demographic questionnaire was filled out for all participants. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the dietary intakes of the study subjects. All nutrients were adjusted for total energy intake. Logistic regression was used to find the association of energy and nutrient intakes with gestational hypertension.

Inconsistent epidemiological results may be explained by varied mechanisms involving PUFAs and redox balance, inflammatory status and cell signalling, along with interactions with other dietary components such as antioxidants, dietary fibre and more generally fruits and vegetable intakes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the associations between lipid intakes and cancer risk, and their potential modulation by vitamin C, vitamin E, dietary fibre and fruit and vegetable intakes. METHODS: This prospective study included 44,039 participants aged ≥ 45 years from the NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2017). Dietary data were collected using repeated 24 h-dietary records. Multivariable Cox models were performed to characterize associations. RESULTS: SFA intake was associated with increased overall [n = 1722 cases, HR(Q5vsQ1) = 1.44 (1.10-1.87), p-trend = 0.008] and breast [n = 545 cases, HR(Q5vsQ1) = 1.98 (1.24-3.17), p-trend = 0.01] cancer risks. n-6 PUFA [HR(Q5vsQ1) = 0.56 (0.32-0.97), p-trend = 0.01] and MUFA (HR(Q5vsQ1) = 0.41 [0.18-0.0.95), p-trend = 0.009] intakes were associated with a decreased risk of digestive cancers (n = 190 cases). Associations between n-6 PUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intakes and digestive cancer risk were modulated by dietary fibre, vitamin C and fruit and vegetable intakes. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that SFA intake could increase overall and breast cancer risks while some unsaturated fatty acids could decrease digestive cancer risk. However, in line with mechanistic hypotheses, our results suggest that intakes of fruits and vegetables and their constituents (antioxidants, fibre) may interact with PUFAs to modulate these associations.",2019,Jun,Eur J Nutr,58,4,1515-1527,,10.1007/s00394-018-1682-5,29616321,#8962,Sellem 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Dietary food patterns and glucose/insulin homeostasis: a cross-sectional study involving 24,182 adult Americans.",Mazidi M; Kengne AP; Mikhailidis DP; Toth PP; Ray KK; Banach M,"AIM: To investigate the association of major dietary patterns with glucose and insulin homeostasis parameters in a large American sample. The association between dietary patterns (DP) derived via principal components analysis (PCA), with glucose/insulin homeostasis parameters was assessed. The likelihood of insulin resistance (IR) across the DPs quarters was also explored. METHOD: The United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants during 2005-2012 were included if they underwent measurement of dietary intake as well as glucose and insulin homeostasis parameters. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted logistic and linear regression models were employed to account for the complex survey design and sample weights. RESULTS: A total of 24,182 participants were included; 48.9% (n = 11,815) were men. Applying PCA revealed three DP (56.8% of variance): the first was comprised mainly of saturated fat (SFA), total fat, mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and carbohydrate (CHO); the second is highly enriched with vitamins, trace elements and dietary fiber; and the third was composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), cholesterol and protein. Among the total population, after adjustment for age, sex, race, C-reactive protein, smoking, and physical activity, glucose homeostasis factors, visceral adiposity index and lipid accumulation product improved across the quarters of the first and third DP; and a reverse pattern with the second DP. The same trend was observed for the non-diabetic subjects. Moreover, subjects with higher adherence to the first and third DP had higher likelihood for developing IR, whereas there was a lower likelihood for the second DP. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the DP heavily loaded with CHO, SFA, PUFA, protein, total fat and MUFA as well as high-cholesterol-load foods is associated with impaired glucose tolerance; in contrast, the healthy pattern which is high in vitamins, minerals and fiber may have favourable effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.",2017,Oct,Lipids Health Dis,16,1,192,,10.1186/s12944-017-0571-x,28978343,#8974,Mazidi 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

SUBJECTS/METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data of 5675 non-diabetic, middle-aged participants of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study. Associations between habitual dietary intake and fasting and postprandial blood glucose and insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA of β-cell function (HOMA-B) and Disposition Index were assessed through multivariable linear regression models with adjustments for demographic, lifestyle and dietary factors. RESULTS: Mean (s.d.) intakes in percent of energy (En%) were 34.4 (5.8) for total fatty acids, 12.4 (2.9) for SFA, 12.2 (2.4) for MUFA, 6.9 (1.9) for PUFA and 0.6 (0.2) for TFA. As compared with carbohydrates, only SFA was weakly inversely associated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B. When stratified by dietary source, all fatty acids from meat were positively associated with fasting insulin - total fatty acids(meat) (per 5 En%: 10.0%; 95% confidence interval: 4.0, 16.3), SFA(meat) (per 1 En%: 3.7%; 0.4, 7.2), MUFA(meat) (per 1 En%: 5.0%; 2.0, 8.1), PUFA(meat) (per 1 En%: 17.3%; 6.0, 29.7) and TFA(meat) (per 0.1 En%: 10.5%; 3.2, 18.3). Similarly, all fatty acids from meat were positively associated with HOMA-IR and HOMA-B and inversely with Disposition Index. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the relations between fatty acid intakes and markers of type 2 diabetes risk may depend on the dietary sources of the fatty acids.

The relationship between dietary lipids and serum visfatin and adiponectin levels in postmenopausal women.,Rahbar AR; Nabipour I,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in humans, particularly in postmenopausal women. Inflammation has been shown to play a basic role in the development of CVD. In light of the involvement of adipocytokines and dietary lipids in the induction of inflammation in CVD, this study was conducted to investigate the potential relationship between dietary lipids and two well-known adipocytokines, visfatin and adiponectin. A total of 374 postmenopausal women were randomly selected from 13 geographical clusters in Bushehr port. Serum visfatin and adiponectin were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay technique and current dietary intake was recorded with a food frequency questionnaire and a 3-day recall. Each food and beverage was analyzed for macro- and micronutrient content. Bivariate correlation analysis showed a correlation between serum visfatin level and dietary SFA, n-6 PUFA and cholesterol intake. In multiple regression analyses, serum visfatin levels showed a significant positive correlation with dietary SFA (β=0.06, p=0.01), PUFA (β=0.02, p=0.02) and cholesterol (β=0.005, p=0.002) after controlling for age, diabetes, total energy intake and BMI. There was no significant relationship between dietary MUFA intake and serum visfatin level. No significant correlations were found between age- and BMI-adjusted adiponectin and dietary SFA, MUFA or n-6 PUFA intake (p>0.05). We found a positive relationship between dietary SFA, PUFA and cholesterol with serum visfatin level in postmenopausal women, and conclude that the postmenopause-induced inflammatory responses may be modulated at least in part by dietary modification.",2014,,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets,14,2,84-92,,10.2174/1871530314666140527143009,24867620,#9009,Rahbar 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Intra-pancreatic fat deposition as a modifier of the relationship between habitual dietary fat intake and insulin resistance.,Ko J; Skudder-Hill L; Tarrant C; Kimita W; Bharmal SH; Petrov MS,"BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance is a well-known derangement after an attack of pancreatitis but the role of dietary fat intake and intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) in it is unknown. We aimed to investigate the relationship of dietary fat intake with markers of insulin resistance in individuals after acute pancreatitis, taking into account IPFD. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. The EPIC-Norfolk food frequency questionnaire was used to determine the habitual intake of saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids. The studied markers of insulin resistance were fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and METS-IR. 3 T magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify IPFD. Linear regression analysis, with adjustment for possible confounders, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 111 individuals after acute pancreatitis (33 low IPFD, 40 moderate IPFD, and 38 high IPFD) were included. In the high IPFD group, intake of monounsaturated fatty acids was inversely associated with both fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR, and METS-IR in the unadjusted (β = -65.405, p < 0.001; β = -15.762, p < 0.001; β = -0.760, p = 0.041, respectively) and fully adjusted models (β = -155.620, p < 0.001; β = -34.656, p < 0.001, β = -2.008, p = 0.018, respectively). Intake of polyunsaturated or saturated fatty acids did not have a consistently significant pattern of associations with the three markers of insulin resistance. None of the above associations was significant in the low IPFD and moderate IPFD groups. CONCLUSIONS: Habitual dietary fat intake is associated with insulin resistance only in individuals after an attack of pancreatitis who have high IPFD. These indviduals may benefit from a calorically balanced diet that is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids.",2021,Jul,Clin Nutr,40,7,4730-4737,,10.1016/j.clnu.2021.06.017,34237700,#9023,Ko 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The effect of a low glycemic load diet on acne vulgaris and the fatty acid composition of skin surface triglycerides.,Smith RN; Braue A; Varigos GA; Mann NJ,"BACKGROUND: Dietary factors have long been implicated in acne pathogenesis. It has recently been hypothesized that low glycemic load diets may influence sebum production based on the beneficial endocrine effects of these diets. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a low glycemic load diet on acne and the fatty acid composition of skin surface triglycerides. METHODS: Thirty-one male acne patients (aged 15-25 years) completed sebum sampling tests as part of a larger 12-week, parallel design dietary intervention trial. The experimental treatment was a low glycemic load diet, comprised of 25% energy from protein and 45% from low glycemic index carbohydrates. In contrast, the control situation emphasized carbohydrate-dense foods without reference to the glycemic index. Acne lesion counts were assessed during monthly visits. At baseline and 12-weeks, the follicular sebum outflow and composition of skin surface triglycerides were assessed using lipid absorbent tapes. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, subjects on the experimental diet demonstrated increases in the ratio of saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids of skin surface triglycerides when compared to controls [5.3+/-2.0% (mean+/-S.E.M.) vs. -2.7+/-1.7%, P=0.007]. The increase in the saturated/monounsaturated ratio correlated with acne lesion counts(r=-0.39, P=0.03). Increased follicular sebum outflow was also associated with an increase in the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids in sebum (r=0.49, P=0.006). CONCLUSION: This suggests a possible role of desaturase enzymes in sebaceous lipogenesis and the clinical manifestation of acne. However, further work is needed to clarify the underlying role of diet in sebum gland physiology.",2008,Apr,J Dermatol Sci,50,1,41-52,,10.1016/j.jdermsci.2007.11.005,18178063,#9026,Smith 2008,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Mediterranean dietary pattern and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases: a case-control study.,Entezari MR; Talenezhad N; Mirzavandi F; Rahimpour S; Mozaffari-Khosravi H; Fallahzadeh H; Hosseinzadeh M,"The Mediterranean (MED) diet was associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease, but the epidemiological studies reported inconsistent findings related to the MED diet and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk. This age and the gender-matched case-control study were conducted among 247 adult patients. The MED diet score was obtained based on the Trichopoulou model. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between the MED diet and NAFLD risk. NAFLD prevalence in people with low, moderate and high adherence to the MED diet was 33, 13⋅1 and 4⋅6 %, respectively. The increasing intake of the MED diet was significantly related to the increment intake of nuts and fruits, vegetables, monounsaturated fatty acid/polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio, legumes, cereals and fish. However, total energy consumption, low-fat dairy and meats intake were reduced (P for all < 0⋅05). Following control for age, the person in the highest of the MED diet tertile compared with the lowest, the odds of NAFLD decreased (OR: 0⋅40, 95 % CI: 0⋅17-0⋅95). This relation became a little stronger after further adjusting for sex, diabetes, physical activity and supplement intake (OR: 0⋅36, 95 % CI: 0⋅15-0⋅89). However, this association disappeared after adjusting for body mass index, waist and hip circumference (OR: 0⋅70, 95 % CI: 0⋅25-1⋅97). High adherence to the MED diet was associated with a 64 % reduction in NAFLD odds before some anthropometric variable adjustments.

Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Association of Low-Carbohydrate Diet With Mortality in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.,Oh SW; Wood AC; Hwang SS; Allison M,"IMPORTANCE: Evidence linking low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) to mortality is limited among multiethnic populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between LCDs and mortality by race and ethnicity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis is a large, population-based prospective cohort study of adults aged 45 to 84 years recruited from 6 US communities. A total of 6109 participants without baseline cardiovascular disease were included in this analysis. Baseline data were collected from July 2000 to August 2002, with follow-up completed by December 2017. The data were analyzed between May 2021 and April 2022. EXPOSURES: Food frequency questionnaires were used to assess dietary intake. From these data, overall LCD scores were calculated from the percentages of energy intake from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Animal-based (emphasizing saturated fat and animal protein) and vegetable-based (emphasizing monounsaturated fat and vegetable protein) LCD scores were also calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause and cause-specific mortality over a median follow-up of 15.9 years (IQR, 14.3-16.6 years). RESULTS: Among the 6109 participants (mean [SD] age, 62.3 [10.3] years; 3190 women [52.2%]; 1623 African American [26.6%], 701 Chinese American [11.5%], 1350 Hispanic [22.1%], and 2435 non-Hispanic White [39.8%]), there were 1391 deaths. Overall, LCD scores were not associated with mortality, but when analyses were stratified by race and ethnicity, a lower risk of all-cause and non-CV mortality was observed among Hispanic participants with moderate carbohydrate intake. Specifically, the hazard ratios for total mortality for overall LCD scores were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.40-0.84) for quintile 2, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.45-0.98) for quintile 3, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.41-0.87) for quintile 4, and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.57-1.21) for quintile 5, with quintile 1 as the reference group. A similar association was observed for animal-based (but not vegetable-based) LCD scores. In contrast, no significant associations were found between LCD scores and mortality risk in the other racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of multiethnic US adults, LCD score was not associated with mortality in the whole population. However, moderate carbohydrate intake was associated with a lower risk of mortality among Hispanic participants. These findings suggest that the association between carbohydrate intake and mortality may differ according to race and ethnicity. Dietary guidelines considering these differences may be necessary.",2022,Oct,JAMA Netw Open,5,10,e2237552,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.37552,36264576,#9052,Oh 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Macronutrients Intake and Incident Frailty in Older Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study.,Sandoval-Insausti H; Pérez-Tasigchana RF; López-García E; García-Esquinas E; Rodríguez-Artalejo F; Guallar-Castillón P,"BACKGROUND: Only a few studies have assessed the association between protein intake and frailty incidence and have obtained inconsistent results. This study examined the association of protein and other macronutrient intake with the risk of frailty in older adults. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 1,822 community-dwelling individuals aged 60 and older was recruited in 2008-2010 and followed-up through 2012. At baseline, food consumption was assessed with a validated, computerized face-to-face diet history. In 2012, individuals were contacted again to ascertain incident frailty, defined as the presence of at least three of the five Fried criteria: low physical activity, slowness, unintentional weight loss, muscle weakness, and exhaustion. Analyses were performed using logistic regression and adjusted for the main confounders, including total energy intake. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, 132 persons with incident frailty were identified. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of frailty across increasing quartiles of total protein were 1.00, 0.55 (0.32-0.93), 0.45 (0.26-0.78), and 0.41 (0.23-0.72); p trend: .001. The corresponding figures for animal protein intake were 1.00, 0.68 (0.40-1.17), 0.56 (0.32-0.97), and 0.48 (0.26-0.87), p trend: .011. And for intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), the results were 1.00, 0.66 (0.37-1.20), 0.54 (0.28-1.02), and 0.50 (0.26-0.96); p trend: .038. No association was found between intake of vegetable protein, saturated fats, long-chain ω-3 fatty acids, α-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, simple sugars, or polysaccharides and the risk of frailty.

The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study.",Pietinen P; Ascherio A; Korhonen P; Hartman AM; Willett WC; Albanes D; Virtamo J,"The relation of intakes of specific fatty acids and the risk of coronary heart disease was examined in a cohort of 21,930 smoking men aged 50-69 years who were initially free of diagnosed cardiovascular disease. All men participated in the Finnish Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study and completed a detailed and validated dietary questionnaire at baseline. After 6.1 years of follow-up from 1985-1988, the authors documented 1,399 major coronary events and 635 coronary deaths. After controlling for age, supplement group, several coronary risk factors, total energy, and fiber intake, the authors observed a significant positive association between the intake of trans-fatty acids and the risk of coronary death. For men in the top quintile of trans-fatty acid intake (median = 6.2 g/day), the multivariate relative risk of coronary death was 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.78) (p for trend = 0.004) as compared with men in the lowest quintile of intake (median = 1.3 g/day). The intake of omega-3 fatty acids from fish was also directly related to the risk of coronary death in the multivariate model adjusting also for trans-saturated and cis-monounsaturated fatty acids (relative risk (RR) = 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.67) (p for trend = 0.06 for men in the highest quintile of intake compared with the lowest).

Consumption of Two Healthy Dietary Patterns Restored Microbiota Dysbiosis in Obese Patients with Metabolic Dysfunction.,Haro C; García-Carpintero S; Rangel-Zúñiga OA; Alcalá-Díaz JF; Landa BB; Clemente JC; Pérez-Martínez P; López-Miranda J; Pérez-Jiménez F; Camargo A,"SCOPE: The consumption of two healthy diets (Mediterranean (MED) and low-fat (LF) diets) may restore the gut microbiome dysbiosis in obese patients depending on the degree of metabolic dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: The differences in bacterial community at baseline and after 2 years of dietary intervention of 106 subjects from the CORDIOPREV study were analyzed, 33 of whom were obese patients with severe metabolic disease (5 criteria for metabolic syndrome) (MetS-OB), 32 obese patients without metabolic dysfunction (2 or less criteria for metabolic syndrome) (NonMetS-OB) and 41 non-obese subjects (NonMetS-NonOB). Our study showed a marked dysbiosis in people with severe metabolic disease (Met-OB), compared with obese people without MetS (NonMetS-OB) and non-obese people (NonMetS-NonOB). This disbiotic pattern was reversed by consumption of both MED (35% of calories as fat (22% MUFA fat, 6% PUFA fat and <10% saturated fat) or LF (<30% total fat (<10% saturated fat, 12%-14% MUFA fat and 6-8% PUFA fat) diets, whereas no significant microbiota changes were observed in NonMetS-NonOB and NonMetS-OB groups.

"Changes in Lutein Status Markers (Serum and Faecal Concentrations, Macular Pigment) in Response to a Lutein-Rich Fruit or Vegetable (Three Pieces/Day) Dietary Intervention in Normolipemic Subjects.",Olmedilla-Alonso B; Rodríguez-Rodríguez E; Beltrán-de-Miguel B; Sánchez-Prieto M; Estévez-Santiago R,"Lutein is mainly supplied by dietary fruit and vegetables, and they are commonly jointly assessed in observational and interventional studies. Lutein bioavailability and health benefits depend on the food matrix. This study aimed to assess the effect of dietary intervention with lutein-rich fruit or vegetables on lutein status markers, including serum and faecal concentrations (by high pressure liquid chromatography), dietary intake (24 h recalls ×3), and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and contrast threshold (CT) as visual outcomes. Twenty-nine healthy normolipemic subjects, aged 45-65 y, consumed 1.8 mg lutein/day supplied from fruits (14 subjects, 500 g/day of oranges, kiwi and avocados) or vegetables (15 subjects, 180 g/day of green beans, pumpkin, and sweet corn) for four weeks. Serum lutein concentration increased by 37%. The effect of the food group intervention was statistically significant for serum lutein+zeaxanthin concentration (p = 0.049). Serum α- and β-carotene were influenced by food type (p = 0.008 and p = 0.005, respectively), but not by time. Serum lutein/HDL-cholesterol level increased by 29% (total sample, p = 0.008). Lutein+zeaxanthin/HDL-cholesterol increased, and the intervention time and food group eaten had an effect (p = 0.024 and p = 0.010, respectively) which was higher in the vegetable group. The MPOD did not show variations, nor did it correlate with CT. According to correlation matrixes, serum lutein was mainly related to lutein+zeaxanthin expressed in relation to lipids, and MPOD with the vegetable group. In faecal samples, only lutein levels increased (p = 0.012). This study shows that a relatively low amount of lutein, supplied by fruit or vegetables, can have different responses in correlated status markers, and that a longer intervention period is needed to increase the MPOD. Therefore, further study with larger sample sizes is needed on the different responses in the lutein status markers and on food types and consumption patterns in the diet, and when lutein in a ""pharmacological dose"" is not taken to reduce a specific risk.",2021,Oct,Nutrients,13,10,,,10.3390/nu13103614,34684614,#9093,Olmedilla-Alonso 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,In database

Associations between dietary patterns and stages of chronic kidney disease.,Lin HI; Chen HM; Hsu CC; Lin HJ; Wang JJ; Weng SF; Kao Y; Huang CC,"BACKGROUND: Studies have revealed that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have dietary patterns different from those of the general population. However, no studies have compared the dietary patterns of between patients with early-stages (stages 1-3a) and late-stages (stages 3b-5) of CKD. Our objective was to investigate the associations between dietary patterns in early and late-stage CKD. METHODS: We analyzed 4480 participants with CKD at various stages based on the data recorded between 2007 and 2016 from the database of the American National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. RESULTS: In total, 3683 and 797 participants had early and late-stage CKD, respectively. Through principal components analysis, the dietary intake dimension was reduced from 63 variables to 3 dietary patterns. We adopted logistic regression for analysis. The three dietary patterns are as follows: (1) saturated fatty acids and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA); (2) vitamins and minerals; and (3) cholesterols and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). These 3 patterns explained > 50% of dietary nutrient intake. Results indicated that among participants with dietary patterns 2 (vitamins and minerals) and 3 (cholesterols and PUFA), those with low intakes were more likely to have late-stage CKD.

RESULTS: Energy intake was acceptable. However, an imbalance nutrient intake was revealed. Concerning macronutrient, fat and protein were above the recommended allowances (p<0.01). Further, the percentage of saturated fatty acids was significantly above the recommended values while the percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids were restricted. Regarding the micronutrient, the intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium were restrictive (p<0.01). As for the fluid intake, a limited contribution was observed (p<0.01). Several correlations between body composition and dietary intake have been found.

METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, a sample of 2750 Tehranian subjects (44% men and 56% women) aged 20-74 years, who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire, was studied. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined in accordance with the modified guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adults Treatment Panel III, and waist circumference was coded according to the newly-introduced cut-off points for Iranian adults (≥95 cm for both sexes). Metabolic risk factors across quartile categories of each type of dietary fat [total fat intake, total poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake, total MUFA intake, total saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake expressed as percentage of energy and quartiles of the ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat (P : S)] were compared. RESULTS: The mean (SD) ages of participants were 40.8 (14.6) and 38.6 (12.9) years, respectively, for men and women. The mean contribution of fat to energy intake was approximately 26% in men and women. A positive trend over successive quartiles of SFA intake with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride, as well as P/S ratio intake with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), was found. An inverse association between HDL-C with SFA and PUFA intake and a positive association with MUFA and the P/S ratio was found. A significant association of fatty acid consumption and risk of the MetS in this population was observed, except for total PUFA intake.

The logistic regression method was employed to assess the relative risk of colonic cancer development for four levels of consumption of each ingredient. The tendency of risk variation was evaluated. The increase in the risk of colonic cancer was accounted for by the high consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids (p = 0.023), starch (p = 0.05) and a rise in meat/vegetables (p less than 0.001), protein/cellulose (p less than 0.001) and fat/cellulose (p = 0.023) ratios. High intake of beta-carotene (p = 0.011), vitamin C (p = 0.003), calcium (p = 0.009) and dairy products (p = 0.003) and increased poly/mono-unsaturated fatty acid ratio (p = 0.014) were associated with low relative risk.",1991,,Vopr Onkol,37,2,152-8,,,2014693,#9259,Zaridze 1991,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of amount and type of dietary fats on postprandial lipemia and thrombogenic markers in individuals with metabolic syndrome.,Teng KT; Chang CY; Kanthimathi MS; Tan AT; Nesaretnam K,"OBJECTIVE: Postprandial lipemia has been reported to affect endothelial function by thrombogenic and inflammatory pathways. We set out to investigate the impact of a) specific amount (50 g vs 20 g fat), and b) type of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated or n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids; SFA, MUFA, PUFA) on postprandial lipemia, thrombogenic and inflammatory factors in metabolic syndrome subjects. DESIGN: 30 subjects (15 men, 15 women) participated in a double-blind, randomized crossover design study with both the subjects and investigators blinded to treatments. Blood samples were collected at fasting and 30 min, hourly interval for a total of 6 h. RESULTS: As expected, lower triacylglycerol response was observed for low fat/high carbohydrate meal; whereas no difference was detected between the types of fatty acids. The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for low fat/high carbohydrate meal was 70%, 81% and 61% lower than the SFA, MUFA and PUFA meals, respectively. The iAUC 0-6 h for triacylglycerol was 42% lower in women compared with the men (P = 0.024), with the similar trend observed for non-esterified fatty acids. There were significant meal × time interaction (P = 0.000) for plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thromboxane B2 (P = 0.022) from baseline. No differences were observed between meals for plasma D-dimer, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and high sensitivity C-reactive protein. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that in metabolic syndrome subjects, only the amount of dietary fatty acids affects postprandial lipemia but both amount and type of dietary fats alter thrombogenic factors.

Nutrition habits of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes changed in a 10 years span.,Maffeis C; Tomasselli F; Tommasi M; Bresadola I; Trandev T; Fornari E; Marigliano M; Morandi A; Olivieri F; Piona C,"BACKGROUND: Diet plays a key role in the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Dietary habits changed rapidly in the last decades and few data are available on recent dietary changes in children and adolescents with T1D. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that diet composition changed in a 10-year period in children and adolescents with T1D. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-nine T1D subjects (M/F:121/108) aged 6 to 16 years were recruited: 114 (group A) enrolled in 2009, not using CGM and/or CSII, and 115 (group B) enrolled in 2019. Anthropometric biochemical (HbA1c, lipid profile), diet, and insulin therapy parameters were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with HbA1c as dependent variable (HbA1c > 58 mmol/mol = 1) and nutritional variables and technology use as independent ones. RESULTS: Energy intake of group A was not statistically different from that of group B. Group B had a significantly (P < 0.001) higher protein and lipids intake and lower total carbohydrate and fiber intake than group A. HbA1c was significantly (P < 0.01) lower in group B than in group A. Logistic regression analysis showed that MUFA (OR 0.83, 95%CI:0.693-0.998), fiber intake (OR 0.82, 95%CI:0.699-0.0969), and technology use (OR 0.15, 95%CI:0.031-0.685), adjusted for age, gender, BMI, energy intake and diabetes duration, were associated with a HbA1c higher than 58 mmol/mol) (R(2) = 0.27, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a 10-year period, diet composition of children and adolescents with T1D changed and glucometabolic control improved. Fiber and MUFA intake showed a positive effect on HbA1c, independent from technology use, supporting the importance of educating children with T1D and families to maintain healthy eating habits.",2020,Sep,Pediatr Diabetes,21,6,960-968,,10.1111/pedi.13053,32418262,#9287,Maffeis 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary linoleate increases fluidity and influences chemical composition of plasma low density lipoprotein in adult men.,Berlin E; Judd JT; Marshall MW; Kliman PG,"Dietary linoleate was effective to increase LDL fluidity in adult men but did not significantly influence VLDL or HDL fluidities. Lipoproteins were isolated ultracentrifugally from plasma of sixteen healthy, free living male volunteers consuming controlled diets formulated from typical U.S.A. foods to have 35 energy % fat with 10 g (diet L) or 30 g (diet H) linoleate per day, 30-50 g saturated fatty acids/day and the balance mainly monounsaturated fatty acids. Calculated cholesterol intakes were 500 mg/day at each calorie level. Changes in LDL fluidity were detected as differences in diphenylhexatriene (DPH) fluorescence polarization upon crossover between the two controlled diets. Thermotropic measurement of DPH fluorescence anisotropy and compositional analyses indicated that LDL and HDL fluidities were dependent upon phospholipid and triacylglycerol concentrations, respectively, and were modulated by the presence of cholesteryl esters. Fatty acid analyses of the major lipid classes of the isolated lipoproteins indicated that changes, upon diet crossover, in DPH fluorescence anisotropy, were a linear function of the incremental change in LDL phospholipid linoleate. The fluorescent probe described an environment corresponding to the fatty acyl moieties of the phospholipids on the LDL periphery, which composition is apparently under dietary control. It is suggested that the diet induced fluidity changes may affect the conformation of the apoprotein moiety on the LDL surface and thus the potential for LDL interaction with cellular LDL receptors.",1987,Aug,Atherosclerosis,66,3,215-25,,10.1016/0021-9150(87)90065-7,3632760,#9307,Berlin 1987,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Telomere Length in Healthy Adults Is Positively Associated With Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids, Including Arachidonic Acid, and Negatively With Saturated Fatty Acids.",Dhillon VS; Deo P; Chua A; Thomas P; Fenech M,"Lymphocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker of aging that may be modified by dietary factors including fat. Red blood cell fatty acid status is a well-validated indicator of long-term dietary intake of fat from various sources. Recent findings from epidemiological studies of LTL in relation to fatty acids in red blood cells are not conclusive. The present study was carried out to investigate if red blood cell fatty acid status in 174 healthy older South Australians is associated with LTL. Lymphocyte telomere length was measured by real-time qPCR and fatty acid content in red blood cells was measured by gas chromatography. Our results indicate that the majority of saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids are negatively associated with LTL, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids are positively associated with LTL. Multiple regression analysis revealed that arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) is significantly, independently, positively correlated with LTL (β = 0.262; p = .000).

Usual dietary intake and cardiovascular risk factors in older Brazilian women.,Nóbrega OT; Paula RS; Silveira SR; Pires AS; Toledo JO; Moraes CF; Córdova C,"AIM: To evaluate habitual macronutrient intake and its association with common cardiovascular risk factors in Brazilian elderly women. METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study with 293 subjects. Carbohydrate, protein and lipid intakes were determined based on a non-consecutive three-day dietary record. The following conditions were evaluated: dyslipidemia, systemic arterial hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical data revealed an elevated prevalence of classic cardiovascular risk factors in the sample. Higher energy intake from omega-3 fatty acid was associated with elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p<0.05), whereas a diet pattern with a relatively lower energy content from monounsaturated fatty acids was associated with the presence of type 2 diabetes (p<0.05).

Saturated Fats Compared With Unsaturated Fats and Sources of Carbohydrates in Relation to Risk of Coronary Heart Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study.,Li Y; Hruby A; Bernstein AM; Ley SH; Wang DD; Chiuve SE; Sampson L; Rexrode KM; Rimm EB; Willett WC; Hu FB,"BACKGROUND: The associations between dietary saturated fats and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) remain controversial, but few studies have compared saturated with unsaturated fats and sources of carbohydrates in relation to CHD risk. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate associations of saturated fats compared with unsaturated fats and different sources of carbohydrates in relation to CHD risk. METHODS: We followed 84,628 women (Nurses' Health Study, 1980 to 2010), and 42,908 men (Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 1986 to 2010) who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer at baseline. Diet was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years. RESULTS: During 24 to 30 years of follow-up, we documented 7,667 incident cases of CHD. Higher intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and carbohydrates from whole grains were significantly associated with a lower risk of CHD comparing the highest with lowest quintile for PUFAs (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73 to 0.88; p trend <0.0001) and for carbohydrates from whole grains (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.98; p trend = 0.003). In contrast, carbohydrates from refined starches/added sugars were positively associated with a risk of CHD (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.21; p trend = 0.04). Replacing 5% of energy intake from saturated fats with equivalent energy intake from PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids, or carbohydrates from whole grains was associated with a 25%, 15%, and 9% lower risk of CHD, respectively (PUFAs, HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.84; p < 0.0001; monounsaturated fatty acids, HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.97; p = 0.02; carbohydrates from whole grains, HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.98; p = 0.01). Replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates from refined starches/added sugars was not significantly associated with CHD risk (p > 0.10).

"Prospective associations of dietary carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake with β-cell function in the CODAM study.",den Biggelaar LJCJ; Eussen SJPM; Sep SJS; Mari A; Ferrannini E; van Greevenbroek MM; van der Kallen CJ; Schalkwijk CG; Arts ICW; Stehouwer CDA; Dagnelie PC,"PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by both impaired pancreatic β-cell function (BCF) and insulin resistance. In the etiology of T2DM, BCF basically determines whether a person with a certain degree of insulin resistance develops T2DM, as β-cells are able to compensatorily increase insulin secretion. The effects of dietary intake on BCF are largely unknown. Our study aim was to investigate whether dietary macronutrient intake predicts BCF. METHODS: Prospective data (median follow-up 7 years) of 303 individuals recruited from the CODAM study population (aged 40-70 years, 39% women) were analyzed. BCF was measured by C-peptide deconvolution and physiological modeling of data from a 5-point, 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Macronutrient intake was estimated by a 178-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. RESULTS: Associations adjusted for relevant covariates of baseline macronutrient intake with model-derived parameters describing BCF (glucose sensitivity, rate sensitivity or potentiation) or C-peptidogenic index were detected for trans fat [standardized regression coefficient (95%-CI) glucose sensitivity - 0.14 (- 0.26, - 0.01)] per g, cholesterol [potentiation 0.20 (0.02, 0.37)] per 100 mg, dietary fiber [glucose sensitivity 0.21 (0.08, 0.33)] per 10 g, MUFA glucose sensitivity 0.16 (0.02, 0.31) per 10 g, and polysaccharide [potentiation - 0.24 (- 0.43, - 0.05), C-peptidogenic index - 0.16 (- 0.29 - 0.03); odds ratio lowest versus highest tertile (95%-CI) rate sensitivity 1.51 (1.06, 2.15)) per 50 g.

Enhanced peripheral vasodilation in humans after a fatty meal.,Raitakari OT; Lai N; Griffiths K; McCredie R; Sullivan D; Celermajer DS,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to study the effects of a fatty meal on vascular reactivity, including endothelial function and maximal vasodilation. BACKGROUND: Recent reports regarding the physiological changes in peripheral vasculature after eating a fatty meal have been controversial. METHODS: Twelve volunteers were studied before, 3 h after, and 6 h after a high-fat meal (1030 kcal, 61 g fat) rich in saturated fatty acids, and 10 were restudied after a similar meal rich in monounsaturated fatty acids. Endothelial function was assessed as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in the brachial artery using ultrasound. Resting and postischemic forearm blood flow (FBF) were recorded using venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography, before, and every 10 to 15 s after, 5 min upper arm ischemia. RESULTS: Brachial artery basal diameter, resting FBF and postischemic hyperemia increased after high-fat meals (all p<0.001), whereas FMD did not change. The increase in resting FBF correlated with increases in postprandial insulin (r = 0.80, p<0.002) and triglyceride (r = 0.77, p<0.005) levels. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that eating a fatty meal induces vasodilation and increases resting and stimulated FBF and that these observations are probably mediated by postprandial changes in insulin and/or triglyceride levels.

Fatty acid composition of serum lipid fractions in relation to gender and quality of dietary fat.,Nikkari T; Luukkainen P; Pietinen P; Puska P,"The fatty acid compositions of serum lipid fractions are believed to reflect the quality of dietary fat, but only a few cross-sectional studies have examined these relationships in a representative free-living population. We related the composition of dietary fat obtained by 7-day food records from 84 free-living middle-aged married couples, on their habitual diets, to gas chromatographic analyses of the percentage compositions of fatty acids in three lipid fractions of fasting sera. Dietary polyunsaturated fat had Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.63, 0.73 and 0.44 with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum cholesteryl esters, triglycerides and phospholipids, respectively. Intake of fish showed correlations of 0.60, 0.36 and 0.52 with the percentage of eicosapentaenoate in the respective fractions. Dietary saturated fat had correlations of 0.57 and 0.54 with saturated fatty acids in serum cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, respectively. Dietary monounsaturated fat did not correlate positively with monounsaturated fatty acids in any serum lipid fraction. There were some small but significant gender differences in the serum fatty acid compositions. CONCLUSIONS: of the three serum lipid fractions, triglycerides appear to be the best reflectors of dietary polyunsaturated and saturated fat, but the intake of monounsaturated fat is poorly reflected in all serum lipid fractions.

Nutrition and serum cholesterol levels among elderly men and women (Dutch Nutrition Surveillance System).,Löwik MR; Wedel M; Kok FJ; Odink J; Westenbrink S; Meulmeester JF,"Associations of serum cholesterol with relevant dietary intake variables (assessed with the dietary history method) and body mass index were investigated in elderly men (n = 199) and women (n = 180) 65-79 years old. All subjects were apparently healthy, nondiabetic, and not on a dietary regimen. The associations were studied separately for men and women using linear regression analysis and all possible subsets regression analysis. Among men, body mass index (kg/m2) and intake of monounsaturated fat and of alcohol were positively and consistently associated with serum total cholesterol. Among women, intake of alcohol and of saturated fat were positively associated, and intake of polysaccharides was inversely associated with serum total cholesterol. The intake of monounsaturated fatty acids was highly (r greater than .60) positively correlated with the intake of total fat and saturated fatty acids, and inversely with carbohydrates. HDL-cholesterol was positively associated with alcohol intake (significant for men only), and inversely with body mass index (women). The results indicate that the effect of dietary factors on serum cholesterol levels is probably not age-limited. Elderly people may potentially benefit from weight reduction or control, moderate alcohol consumption, and avoidance of too much dietary fat. These suggestions are in fair accordance with general population-based guidelines for a healthy diet.

Dietary intake and cognitive function in a group of elderly people.,Ortega RM; Requejo AM; Andrés P; López-Sobaler AM; Quintas ME; Redondo MR; Navia B; Rivas T,"Associations between dietary intake and cognitive performance were examined in 260 elderly people aged 65-90 y who were free of significant cognitive impairment. Dietary intake was monitored with a weighed-food record for 7 consecutive days. The subjects' cognitive capacity was tested by using Folstein et al's Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Pfeiffer's Mental Status Questionnaire (PMSQ). Subjects with adequate MMSE results (> or = 28 points) had lower intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol, and higher intakes of total food, fruit, carbohydrate, thiamine, folate, and vitamin C compared with those with less satisfactory results. Subjects who made no errors on the PMSQ had greater intakes of total food, vegetables, fruit, carbohydrate, fiber, folate, vitamin C, beta-carotene, iron, and zinc, and lower intakes of saturated fatty acids compared with those who made errors. Our results agree with those of other authors indicating that intakes of different nutrients or the consumption of a more satisfactory global diet is associated with better cognitive function in the elderly. However, more research is required to determine whether differences in intake of a particular nutrient are the result of or a conditioning factor for incipient impaired cognition. Unmeasured confounding factors may also affect both dietary intake and risk of cognitive impairment.

[The plasma profile of fatty acids in vegetarians].,Krajcovicová-Kudlácková M; Simoncic R; Klvanová J; Béderová A; Babinská K; Grancicová E,"The plasma profile of fatty acids has been observed in 27 vegetarian adults, their age ranging from 20 to 63 years (13 men, 14 women) with the average period of vegetarian dietary pattern being 8.8 years. A third of the men and a half of the women were lacto-vegetarians, the rest of them were lacto-ovo-vegetarians. The contents of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids insignificantly decreased in vegetarians when compared with non-vegetarians (n = 26, 12 men, 14 women, average group of non-smokers with mixed nutrition). The results of parameters regarded as positive factors in vegetarian diet and effective in prevention of atherosclerosis are as follows: significantly higher values of linoliec acid C 18:2, a significantly higher ratio of linoliec/leic acids C 18:2/C18:1 and insignificantly higher value of linolenic acid C 18:3, together with an unchanged, or moderately decreased contents of poly-unsaturated fatty acids C 20:4 (arachidonic acid) and C 22:6 (n3; docosahexaenoic acid). Further prooxidative-antioxidative parameters were selected in regard to the theoretical anticipation of risk brought about by increased lipoperoxidation in vegetarians (poly-unsaturated fatty acids-substrate of the process) which is significant in the etiology of cardio-vascular and oncologic diseases. Their favourable values (significantly lower plasma contents of conjugated dienes of fatty acids, significantly higher plasma value of vitamin C, Beta-carotene, vitamin E/cholesterol-protection of LDL, vitamin E/triacylglycerols-protection of fatty acids, 3.5 times more significant positive linear correlation of vitamin E/triacylglycerol versus plasma contents of C 18:2) eliminate the risk of increased lipoperoxidation in vegetarians.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the association between total fat intake and fat subtypes with the risk of CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) and cardiovascular and all-cause death. We also examined the hypothetical effect of the isocaloric substitution of one macronutrient for another. DESIGN: We prospectively studied 7038 participants at high CVD risk from the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study. The trial was conducted from 2003 to 2010, but the present analysis was based on an expanded follow-up until 2012. At baseline and yearly thereafter, total and specific fat subtypes were repeatedly measured by using validated food-frequency questionnaires. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used. RESULTS: After 6 y of follow-up, we documented 336 CVD cases and 414 total deaths. HRs (95% CIs) for CVD for those in the highest quintile of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake compared with those in the lowest quintile were 0.58 (0.39, 0.86), 0.50 (0.31, 0.81), and 0.68 (0.48, 0.96), respectively. In the comparison between extreme quintiles, higher saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans-fat intakes were associated with 81% (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.13) and 67% (HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.57) higher risk of CVD.

However, previous data about other dietary fatty acids, such as n-6 PUFA, are conflicting, and little is known about saturated fatty acids (SFA), especially when considering carbon chain length. Thus, we investigated whether single types and subtypes of dietary fats are related to depressive symptoms in Italian individuals living in the Mediterranean area. METHODS: Dietary and socio-demographic data of 1572 individuals were analyzed. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were used to determine the consumption of total dietary fat and each specific class of dietary fat, such as SFA, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and PUFA. The intake of fatty acids was also assessed according to the carbon-chain length of each single class. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used as a screening tool for depressive symptoms. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounding factors, a significant inverse association between low/moderate levels of PUFA intake and depressive symptoms (Q2 vs. Q1, odds ratio (OR) = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.84) was found. On the other hand, moderate saturated fat consumption was associated with depressive symptoms (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.04). However, when considering carbon chain length, individuals with a lower to moderate intake of short-chain saturated fatty acids (SCSFA) and medium-chain saturated fatty acids (MCSFA) were less likely to have depressive symptoms (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.75), while moderate intake of arachidic acid (C20:0) was directly associated with depressive symptoms (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.77). Among single MUFAs, higher myristoleic acid (C14:1) intake was directly associated with depressive symptoms (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.61), while moderate intake of erucic acid (C22:1) was associated with lower odds of having depressive symptoms (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.86). When considering individual PUFAs, individuals with moderate and higher intakes of arachidonic acid (C20:4) were less likely to have depressive symptoms (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.91; OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.91, respectively). Similarly, higher eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) intake was inversely associated with depressive symptoms (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.98), while a significant association for docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) was retrieved only for low intakes (Q2 vs. Q1, OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fat intake may be associated with depressive symptoms, underlying the importance of distinguishing between different fat types. This study confirms the pivotal role of PUFAs and reopens the debate on the role of saturated fatty acids, suggesting plausible effects of moderate intakes of short-chain fatty acids.",2023,Jan,Nutrients,15,3,,,10.3390/nu15030675,36771380,#9388,Currenti 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Additive and Interactive Associations of Environmental and Sociodemographic Factors with the Genotypes of Three Glutathione S-Transferase Genes in Relation to the Blood Arsenic Concentrations of Children in Jamaica.,Rahbar MH; Samms-Vaughan M; Zhao Y; Saroukhani S; Zaman SF; Bressler J; Hessabi M; Grove ML; Shakspeare-Pellington S; Loveland KA,"Arsenic (As) is a metalloid that has been classified as a xenobiotic with toxic effects on human beings, especially on children. Since the soil in Jamaica contains As, dietary intake is considered the main source of As exposure in Jamaicans. In addition, glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes, including GSTT1, GSTP1, and GSTM1, play an important role in the metabolism of xenobiotics including As in humans. Using data from 375 typically developing children (2-8 years) in Jamaica, we investigated the environmental and sociodemographic factors, as well as their possible interactions with the children's genotype for GST genes in relation to having a detectable level of blood As concentration (i.e., >1.3 μg/L). Using multivariable logistic regression, we have identified environmental factors significantly associated with blood As concentrations that include a child's age, parental education levels, and the consumption of saltwater fish, cabbage, broad beans, and avocado (all p < 0.01). Based on the multivariable analysis including gene x environment interactions, we found that among children with the Ile/Ile genotype for GSTP1 Ile105Val, children who consumed avocado had higher odds of having a detectable blood As concentration compared to children who did not eat avocado.",2022,Jan,Int J Environ Res Public Health,19,1,,,10.3390/ijerph19010466,35010728,#9400,Rahbar 2022,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Relations between nutrient intake and serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels.,Gonzalez-Requejo A; Sanchez-Bayle M; Baeza J; Arnaiz P; Vila S; Asensio J; Ruiz-Jarabo C,"OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between diet and serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels in a large, homogeneous group of Spanish children. DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Eleven schools chosen at random in Madrid City and the surrounding area. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects comprised 1682 children, 2 to 12 years of age. Dietary data were obtained with a 24-hour record performed by the child's main caregiver. For statistical analysis the sample was divided into tertiles on the basis of calorie-adjusted consumption of dietary components. RESULTS: Children in the highest tertile of total fat consumption, compared with children in the lowest tertile, had significantly higher mean serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A) and apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B). When compared with children in the lowest tertile, children in the highest tertile of saturated fat consumption had significantly higher mean levels of TC, LDL-C, and Apo B, and lower mean levels of HDL-C and Apo A. Children in the highest tertile of monounsaturated fat consumption, compared with children in the lowest tertile, had significantly higher mean levels of HDL-C and Apo A, and lower mean levels of TC, LDL-C, and Apo B.

Dietary intake of fatty acids and serum C-reactive protein in Japanese.,Yoneyama S; Miura K; Sasaki S; Yoshita K; Morikawa Y; Ishizaki M; Kido T; Naruse Y; Nakagawa H,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation has been established as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The relationships of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids to inflammation are still controversial in Western populations. The relationships are not clear in Japanese whose intake of seafood-based long-chain n-3 PUFAs is high. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic study in the Japanese population (1,556 men and 1,461 women aged 35-60). Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured, and intakes of 7 specific fatty acids (% of energy) were evaluated by a validated self-administered dietary history questionnaire. RESULTS: CRP was significantly and inversely related to the intakes of oleic acid (p=0.008) and alpha-linolenic acid (p=0.026) in women after adjustment for confounding factors. A multiple regression analysis showed that, especially in the middle tertile of long-chain n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) intake, CRP was inversely related to the intake of oleic acid and linoleic acid in both sexes and to the intake of alpha-linolenic acid in women. CONCLUSION: Intakes of oleic acid, linoleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid would reduce serum CRP, especially when the intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs is at a moderate level in Japanese.",2007,May,J Epidemiol,17,3,86-92,,10.2188/jea.17.86,17545695,#9457,Yoneyama 2007,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary lipid intake only partially influences variance in serum phospholipid fatty acid composition in adolescents: impact of other dietary factors.,Vyncke K; Huybrechts I; Van Winckel M; Cuenca Garcia M; Labayen I; Gottrand F; Widhalm K; Leclercq C; Libuda L; Manios Y; Sjostrom M; Molnar D; Moreno LA; Gonzalez-Gross M; Spinneker A; Perez de Heredia F; Plada M; De Henauw S,"The present study aimed to assess the correlation between food and fatty acid (FA) intake and the serum phospholipid (PL) FA status in European adolescents and explored the percentage of variation in serum PL FA that could be attributed to dietary habits. Participants included 528 adolescents recruited in the HELENA Study. Dietary intake was assessed by two, self-administered, non-consecutive 24-h recalls. PL FA concentrations were measured in fasting venous serum samples. Reduced rank regressions were applied to examine the combined effect of food intakes. Results indicated that the variance in serum PL FA in adolescents, that could be explained by diet varied from 7.0% for MUFA to 14.2% for n-3FA. The variance in the long-chain n-3FA was mainly explained by fish intake but also by coffee and tea consumption. In conclusion this study indicated that dietary intake influences the serum PL FA status to a limited amount but that also other factors interfere. However, dietary intake is important as it is among those factors that could be modified. Furthermore, the results suggest that the overall dietary habits should be considered instead of only the consumption of single foods or nutrients, as the medium of the food or concomitant intake of foods and nutrients might interact and as such influence absorption or metabolism.",2014,Sep,Lipids,49,9,881-93,,10.1007/s11745-014-3935-2,25119486,#9499,Vyncke 2014,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
[Changes in serum and adipose tissue fatty acid composition after low calorie diet with respect to dietary fat content in obese].,Vecka M; Richterová B; Zák A; Tvrzická E; Srámková P; Stanková B; Klimcáková E; Stich V,"BACKGROUND: Recently, a new attention has been paid to beneficial effects of high-fat diet on the body weight reduction and metabolic profile in obese subjects. In this study we compared the effects of two hypocaloric diets with different proportion of fat on fatty acid composition (FA) in blood and adipose tissue (AT). METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-four obese subjects were submitted to 10 weeks' low-calorie diet. Subjects were randomized into low-fat diet (LFD) (20-25% of energy content) and high-fat diet groups (HFD) (40-45%). Before and at the end of the intervention, samples of blood and subcutaneous AT were taken for the analysis of fatty acid composition. The diet-induced body weight and fat mass reduction were not different between the two diets. Plasma triacylglycerols (TAG) were reduced during HFD only. Both diets reduced proportion of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in AT and of saturated fatty acid in blood TAG, with no difference between the diets. HFD induced a higher increase of monounsaturated fatty acids in blood TAG. No other diet-induced changes were found in proportion of major classes of fatty acids. In respect to individual fatty acids, the diets induced a number of changes in AT and blood, the changes, however, not being different between the diets. CONCLUSION: Hypocaloric diets induce a number of changes in fatty acid composition in blood and adipose tissue, with little differences in respect to the proportion of fat in the diet. The results suggest the diet-induced changes in fatty acid composition are controlled by the calorie deficit of the diet and the proportion of dietary fat plays a minor role.",2006,,Cas Lek Cesk,145,6,464-9,,,16835999,#9556,Vecka 2006,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,Awaiting PDF
Individual serum triglyceride responses to high-fat and low-fat diets differ in men with modest and severe hypertriglyceridemia.,Jacobs B; De Angelis-Schierbaum G; Egert S; Assmann G; Kratz M,"It is not yet clear whether a low-fat or a high-fat diet is more suitable for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Therefore, we conducted a dietary study with nonobese hypertriglyceridemic men using a randomized crossover design. After a 2-wk acclimation period, the subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups. One group consumed a low-fat (29% of energy) diet for 3 wk, followed first by a 2-wk washout period, then a 3-wk high-fat (40% of energy) diet period. The second group consumed the low- and high-fat diets in reverse order. Both diets were isocaloric, rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and long-chain (n-3)-PUFAs, and contained no alcohol. Absolute amounts of long-chain (n-3)-PUFAs and fiber were similar, as were the fatty acid and carbohydrate compositions. Serum triglyceride concentrations in fasting subjects decreased during the high-fat diet period by 34% (95% CI = -19 to -46%, P = 0.001), and during the low-fat diet period by 31% (95% CI = -0.5 to -51.8%, P = 0.048). Triglyceride concentrations did not differ between the low- and high-fat diet periods. However, the high-fat diet lowered triglyceride concentrations more effectively in all subjects with a baseline triglyceride concentration < 4.5 mmol/L, whereas the low-fat diet lowered triglyceride levels more effectively in half of the subjects with a baseline value > 4.5 mmol/L. Based on these findings, we recommend a high-fat triglyceride-lowering diet for patients with only slightly elevated serum triglyceride concentrations (<4.5 mmol/L). However, a lower-fat diet is more suitable for some subjects with more distinctly elevated triglyceride concentrations.",2004,Jun,J Nutr,134,6,1400-5,,10.1093/jn/134.6.1400,15173403,#9557,Jacobs 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

This study was conducted to clarify the effects on Lp(a) of trans-fatty acids levels commonly found in U.S. diets. Lp(a) levels were measured in a double-blind study of 29 men and 29 women who ate 4 controlled diets in random order for 6 weeks each. Fatty acids represented 39% to 40% of energy. The diets were: (1) Oleic (16.7% of energy as oleic acid); (2) Moderate trans (3.8% of energy as trans-monoenes, approximately the trans content of the U.S. diet); (3) High trans (6.6% of energy as trans-monoenes); (4) Saturated (16.2% of energy as lauric plus myristic plus palmitic acids). The Saturated diet lowered Lp(a) levels significantly (by 8% to 11%). Compared to the Oleic diet, the trans diets had no adverse effect on Lp(a) levels when all subjects were considered collectively. A subset with initially high levels of Lp(a) (> or = 30 mg/dL), however, responded to the High trans diet with a slight (5%) increase in Lp(a) levels relative to the Oleic and Moderate trans diets. Thus, in amounts commonly found in the typical U.S. diet, saturated fatty acids consistently decrease Lp(a) concentrations.

The Mediterranean diet and risk of type 2 diabetes in Iranian population.,Khalili-Moghadam S; Mirmiran P; Bahadoran Z; Azizi F,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is fast increasing in recent decades. Limited prospective studies are available on Mediterranean diet protective effect against T2D development. We assessed longitudinal association of the Mediterranean diet with T2D risk in Iranian men and women. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Diet was measured using a 168-item food frequency questionnaire in 2139 adults (free of T2D), aged 20-70 years. All individuals, based on the traditional Mediterranean diet score (MDS), received scores between 0 and 8 points. Multivariate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported for the association of T2D and the MDS, with adjustment of diabetes risk score (DRS) and dietary energy intakes. RESULTS: During follow-up, a total of 143 events occurred. Individuals who had higher intakes of fish/sea foods, legumes, nuts, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to saturated fatty acids (SFAs) ratio had a decreased risk of T2D.

Six to 13 years later, cognitive function was evaluated through the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and affective state through the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). RESULTS: MMSE score was positively associated with years of formal education, height and physical activity and inversely with age, diabetes mellitus and GDS score (P < 0.05 for all). Among dietary variables, intake of PUFA was inversely associated with cognitive function and this association was largely accounted for by a similar association with seed oils. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as well as intake of olive oil, MUFA and SFA exhibited weakly positive but not significant associations.

Association between dietary fat quality indices with anthropometric measurements in children and adolescents.,Mozafarinia M; Heidari-Beni M; Abbasi B; Kelishadi R,"BACKGROUND: The association between anthropometric measures and dietary fat quality indices is unclear in pediatric age groups. The present study aimed to assess the association between dietary lipophilic index (LI) and thrombogenic index (TI) as dietary fat quality indices with anthropometric measurements in children and adolescents. METHOD: This nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted on 4323 students aged 6-18 years that were selected by multistage cluster sampling from 31 provinces of Iran. Dietary intake was collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire and dietary LI and TI were calculated by formula. Data on anthropometric measures were collected by standard protocols. RESULTS: The multivariate regression analysis revealed that TI and LI had inverse association with neck circumference Z-score (β = 0.11, p = 0.013 and β = 0.12 p = 0.006, respectively). There was a positive correlation between LI with height Z-score (β = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.01, p = 0.009). However, there was no significant association between LI and TI with other anthropometric indices (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The quality of dietary fats was associated with some anthropometric indices. Further large-scale studies are required to highlight the importance of dietary fat quality indices in relation to cardio-metabolic risk factors in pediatric age groups.

An impact of the diet on serum fatty acid and lipid profiles in Polish vegetarian children and children with allergy.,Gorczyca D; Paściak M; Szponar B; Gamian A; Jankowski A,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Vegetarian diet has become an increasing trend in western world and in Poland. The frequency of allergies is growing, and the effectiveness of vegetarian diet in allergic diseases is a concern for research. We aimed to study an effect of vegetarian diet on lipid profile in serum in a group of Polish children in Poland and to investigate lipid parameters in healthy vegetarian children and in omnivorous children with diagnosed atopic disease. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Serum lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, fatty acids) were assessed in groups of children: healthy vegetarians (n=24) and children with diagnosed atopic diseases (n=16), with control group of healthy omnivores (n=18). Diet classification was assessed by a questionnaire. RESULTS: No differences were observed in serum triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids level in all groups. In the group of Polish vegetarian children, we recorded high consumption of vegetable oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acid, and sunflower oil containing linoleic acid. This observation was associated with higher content of linoleic acid in serum in this group. Among polyunsaturated n-6 fatty acids, linoleic acid revealed significantly (P<0.05) lower levels in allergy vs vegetarian groups. In case of eicosapentaenoic acid (n-3 fatty acid), the allergy group showed higher levels of this compound in comparison to vegetarians.

Cross-sectional studies in humans have reported associations between this locus and obesity, plasma glucose, hypertension and T2D prevalence, supporting its role in cardiovascular risk. However, no longitudinal study has investigated the association between CLOCK gene variation and T2D or CVD incidence. Moreover, although in a previous work we detected a gene-diet interaction between the CLOCK-rs4580704 (C > G) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and monounsaturated (MUFA) intake on insulin resistance, no interventional study has analyzed gene-diet interactions on T2D or CVD outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the association between the CLOCK-rs4580704 SNP and incidence of T2D and CVD longitudinally in 7098 PREDIMED trial (ISRCTN35739639) participants after a median 4.8-year follow-up. We also examined modulation by Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) intervention (high in MUFA) on these associations. RESULTS: We observed a significant association between the CLOCK-rs4580704 SNP and T2D incidence in n = 3671 non-T2D PREDIMED participants, with variant allele (G) carriers showing decreased incidence (dominant model) compared with CC homozygotes (HR: 0.69; 95 % CI 0.54-0.87; P = 0.002). This protection was more significant in the MedDiet intervention group (HR: 0.58; 95 % CI 0.43-0.78; P < 0.001) than in the control group (HR: 0.95; 95 % CI 0.63-1.44; P = 0.818). Moreover, we detected a statistically significant interaction (P = 0.018) between CLOCK-rs4580704 SNP and T2D status on stroke. Thus, only in T2D subjects was CLOCK-rs4580704 SNP associated with stroke risk, G-carriers having decreased risk (HR: 0.61; 95 % CI 0.40-0.94; P = 0.024 versus CC) in the multivariable-adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with our previous results showing a protective effect of the G-allele against hyperglycemia, we extended our findings by reporting a novel association with lower T2D incidence and also suggesting a dietary modulation. Moreover, we report for the first time an association between a CLOCK polymorphism and stroke in T2D subjects, suggesting that core clock genes may significantly contribute to increased CVD risk in T2D.",2016,Jan,Cardiovasc Diabetol,15,,4,ISRCTN/ISRCTN35739639,10.1186/s12933-015-0327-8,26739996,#9684,Corella 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Short-term effects of Mediterranean-type diet intervention on soluble cellular adhesion molecules in subjects with abdominal obesity.,Rallidis LS; Kolomvotsou A; Lekakis J; Farajian P; Vamvakou G; Dagres N; Zolindaki M; Efstathiou S; Anastasiou-Nana M; Zampelas A,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Abdominal obesity (AO) is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and with increased production of adhesion molecules. The present work examined the effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on soluble cellular adhesion molecules in individuals with AO. METHODS: Ninety subjects with AO without cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group and were instructed to follow a Mediterranean-style diet for two months. Intervention group followed a specific relevant food plan with close dietetic supervision and provision of basic foods. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), sP and sE-selectin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured. RESULTS: Subjects in the intervention group increased their intake of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and alcohol compared to controls, while decreased their intake of saturated fat. Although there was a significant decrease in CRP, sP-selectin and in sE-selectin in the intervention group, and an increase in sVCAM-1 in the control group, between-group analysis showed no statistically significant differences. There were also no significant changes in sICAM-1, and IL-6 levels after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Mediterranean-type diet for two months combined with close dietetic supervision showed a beneficial tendency towards the down-regulation of some markers of vascular inflammation, although the comparison between groups after the intervention did not reach statistical significance. A longer period of dietary intervention may be required to further support these changes.",2017,Feb,Clin Nutr ESPEN,17,,38-43,,10.1016/j.clnesp.2016.11.002,28361746,#9689,Rallidis 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
[Effect of the Mediterranean diet on fasting concentrations of activated factor VII in healthy persons].,Gómez P; Fernández de la Puebla RA; Castro P; López-Miranda J; Marín C; Fuentes F; Pérez-Martínez P; Velasco F; Moreno JA; Torres A; Pérez-Jiménez F,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Many clinical and epidemiologic studies suggest that activated factor VII may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease. Our objective was to determine the effect of a Mediterranean diet on plasma levels of activated factor VII in comparison to a low-fat diet and a diet rich in saturated fat. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study population comprised 16 healthy normolipemic men who consumed 3 different diets in consecutive 28-day periods. The first diet was rich in saturated fat (38% calories as fat, 20% saturated fat), the second was a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (28% calories as fat, 10% saturated fat), and the third was enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (38% calories as fat, 22% monounsaturated fat). At the end of each period, plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B, and glucose were measured. Activated factor VII was determined with a coagulation assay. RESULTS: The diet rich in saturated fat was associated with a significant increase in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI, and apolipoprotein B in comparison to the other 2 diets. There were no significant differences between the carbohydrate-rich diet and the Mediterranean diet in any of the lipid parameters. The Mediterranean diet decreased plasma levels of factor VIIa in comparison to the diet rich in saturated fat (34.6+/-15.3 mU/mL vs 101.5+/-19.2 mU/mL; P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to the diet rich in saturated fat or the high-carbohydrates diet, the Mediterranean diet decreased plasma concentrations of activated factor VII in healthy young men. This phenomenon may constitute another protective mechanism of the Mediterranean diet in reducing cardiovascular risk.",2005,Mar,Rev Esp Cardiol,58,3,285-9,,,15766451,#9696,Gómez 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Moderate dietary fat consumption as a risk factor for ischemic heart disease in a population with a low fat intake: a case-control study in Korean men.,Suh I; Oh KW; Lee KH; Psaty BM; Nam CM; Kim SI; Kang HG; Cho SY; Shim WH,"BACKGROUND: Dietary fat intake is associated with the incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in Western countries. In populations in which both the average dietary fat consumption and the incidence of IHD are lower than in Western countries, the association of dietary fat intake with IHD incidence remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a case-control study to examine the association of dietary fat with IHD incidence in Korean men. DESIGN: The case group consisted of 108 patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed myocardial infarction or angiographically confirmed (> or =50% stenosis) IHD who were admitted to a university teaching hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The controls were 142 age-matched patients admitted to the departments of ophthalmology and orthopedic surgery at the same hospital. Dietary fat intake was assessed by a nutritionist using a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI), cigarette use, alcohol intake, exercise, and history of disease were determined during an interview and examination. RESULTS: In a univariate analysis, the mean percentages of energy from total fat, saturated fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly higher in the cases than in the controls. BMI, smoking, and a history of hypertension were associated with the occurrence of IHD. In multiple logistic analyses, total fat intake was a significant risk factor (odds ratio: 1.08 for 1% of energy intake; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.14) after adjustment for BMI and smoking. CONCLUSION: In a population with a relatively low fat intake (19% of energy intake), a moderate increase in total fat intake may be a risk factor for IHD.",2001,Apr,Am J Clin Nutr,73,4,722-7,,10.1093/ajcn/73.4.722,11273846,#9705,Suh 2001,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Insulin response and changes in composition of non-esterified fatty acids in blood plasma of middle-aged men following isoenergetic fatty and carbohydrate breakfasts.,Frape DL; Williams NR; Carpenter KL; Freeman MA; Palmer CR; Fletcher RJ,"It was previously shown that a high plasma concentration of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) persisted after a fatty breakfast, but not after an isoenergetic carbohydrate breakfast, adversely affecting glucose tolerance. The higher concentration after the fatty breakfast may in part have been a result of different mobilization rates of fatty acids. This factor can be investigated as NEFA mobilized from tissues are monounsaturated to a greater extent than those deposited from a typical meal. Twenty-four middle-aged healthy Caucasian men were given oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), and for 28 d isoenergetic breakfasts of similar fat composition but of low (L) or moderate (M) fat content. The composition of NEFA in fasting and postprandial plasma was determined on days 1 and 29. No significant treatment differences in fasting NEFA composition occurred on day 29. During the OGTT and 0-1 h following breakfast there was an increase in plasma long-chain saturated NEFA but a decrease in monounsaturated NEFA (microg/100 microg total NEFA; P<0.001). Between 1 and 3 h following breakfast treatment differences occurred for total saturated and total monounsaturated fatty acids (microg/100 microg total NEFA; P<0.05), expressed as an increase in 18 : 1 and decreases in 16 : 0 and 17 : 0 in treatment M relative to treatment L (P<0.05). Serum insulin attained 35 and 65 mU/l in treatments M and L respectively during this period. Negative correlations were found between 16 : 0 in fasting plasma and both waist:hip circumference (P=0.0009) and insulin response curve area during OGTT (within treatment M, P=0.0001). It is concluded that a normal postprandial insulin response is associated with a rapid change in plasma saturated:monounsaturated NEFA. It is proposed that this change is the result of a variable suppression of fat mobilization, which may partly account for a large difference in postprandial total plasma NEFA between fatty and carbohydrate meals.",2000,Nov,Br J Nutr,84,5,737-45,,,11177189,#9706,Frape 2000,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary modulators of lipid metabolism in the Indian diet-heart study (I.D.H.S.).,Singh RB; Sircar AR; Singh RG; Mani UV; Seth J; Devi L,"Of the 621 adults (25 to 65 years of age, 531 males) with either risk factors or with coronary heart disease (CHD) 310 subjects were given a cardiovasoprotective (CVP) diet (group A) and 311 subjects a normal diet (group B) in a randomized, single blind and controlled fashion. Risk factors and incidence of CHD were comparable between the two groups. The intervention group received a significantly higher percentage of calories in relation to complex carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids and high P:S ratio diet as compared to the control group. The control group received higher saturated fat and cholesterol. Compliance was assessed by dietary questionnaire during the follow-up. After 8 weeks of dietary trial, there was a significant decrease in mean serum total cholesterol (8.2 vs 2.1%), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (9.8 vs. 2.7%) and triglyceride (11.2 vs 5.8%) in the intervention group compared to baseline levels and changes in control subjects. Body weight and physical activity at the entry to study and during the trial were similar in both groups. The decrease in mean HDL cholesterol were insignificant both in the intervention (4.3%) and control group (5.0%). There were no adverse effects of diet during the 8 weeks of trial. It is possible that a diet with 27.5% energy from total fat including 10.1% energy from monounsaturated fatty acids, P:S ratio 1.38, 120 mg dietary cholesterol, 26.0 g dietary fibre per 1000 kcal would modulate the lipid metabolism resulting in a significant reduction in serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride with no reduction in HDL cholesterol. This diet may be capable of reducing CHD incidence and mortality in the long term Indian diet-heart study (IDHS).",1992,,Int J Vitam Nutr Res,62,1,73-82,,,1316885,#9709,Singh 1992,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Impact of nutrients and Mediterranean diet on the occurrence of gestational diabetes.,Mahjoub F; Ben Jemaa H; Ben Sabeh F; Ben Amor N; Gamoudi A; Jamoussi H,"Background: The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is a dietary pattern effective in terms of prevention of many diseases such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Recently, many studies have paid attention to nutritional factors during pregnancy as a modifiable contributor to GDM risk.Objective: to investigate associations of nutrients intakes and MedDiet pattern of eating with risk of GDM.Subjects/Methods: This study conducted on N = 120; Pregnant women with GDM (n = 60) and without controls (n = 60). The dietary habits were assessed by a dietary history method and a validated food frequency questionnaire. We calculated a MedDiet score which measures the degree of adherence to a Med Diet.Result: A low Med Diet score was found in pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes in 46.7% and 38.8% of cases, respectively, with no significant difference. Our data showed that the higher the adherence score to the MedDiet, the lower the fasting blood glucose level and the plasma glucose 2 h post load. These findings concerned the two groups studied (P < 10(-3)). We also noted that controls had a significantly higher intake of legumes, vegetables and fish. Monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids consumption was significantly higher in the control group (2.3 ± 0.8 vs 1.7 ± 0.7, P < 10(-3)). GDM subjects consumed significantly more dairy products and cereals (P < 10(-3)). After adjustment for confounders, no nutrient was associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes except vitamin D intake (OR 0.29 [0.15-0.54], P < 10(-3)) which had a protective effect.Conclusion: Our study underlines the importance of adequate vitamin D intake during pregnancy and suggests that the MedDiet may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes.",2021,Dec,Libyan J Med,16,1,1930346,,10.1080/19932820.2021.1930346,34024269,#9710,Mahjoub 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Association of dietary fatty acids and the incidence risk of cardiovascular disease in adults: the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Prospective Study.,Mirmiran P; Houshialsadat Z; Bahadoran Z; Khalili-Moghadam S; Sheikholeslami F; Azizi F,"BACKGROUND: Considering the inconsistent available findings regarding the cardioprotective effect of dietary fatty acid composition, we prospectively examined the feasible association between the dietary fatty acids and the cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in framework of the population-based Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. METHODS: A total of 2369 participants (19-70 years, 43.5% men) without CVD at baseline (2006-2008) were included and followed-up for 6.7 years. Fatty acids' dietary intake was estimated using a 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The CVD incidence risk across tertiles of dietary fatty acids was predicted via Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: The average age and body mass index of the included population were 38.5 ± 13.3 years and 26.6 ± 4.8 kg/m(2) at baseline. Over 6.7 years of follow-up, 79 cases of CVD were detected. The risk of CVD was lower in upper tertile of monounsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid + eicosapentaenoic acid among the tertiles. No significant associations were found between total fat, saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids' intake, and CVD.

Cross-sectional study on the relationship between the Mediterranean Diet Score and blood lipids.,Mertens E; Mullie P; Deforche B; Lefevre J; Charlier R; Huybrechts I; Clarys P,"BACKGROUND: Blood lipids are cardiovascular health indicators. High LDL cholesterol values and/or high total cholesterol (TC)/HDL cholesterol ratios are positively related with cardiovascular mortality. Evidence suggests that a Mediterranean diet can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is often measured by the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). However, the association between the Mediterranean diet and blood lipid profiles seems still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the MDS, its different components and blood lipid profiles. METHODS: A sample of 506 women and 707 men (aged 18-75 years) was recruited. Three-day diet records were used to calculate the MDS. Blood samples were analyzed for serum TC, LDL and HDL cholesterol. ANOVA was used to analyze blood lipids across the MDS tertiles. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the associations between the MDS, its components and blood lipids, adjusted for several confounders. All analyses were stratified by gender. RESULTS: Few gender-specific associations were found between the MDS, its components and blood lipids. Only in men, the total MDS was negatively related with LDL cholesterol and the ratio TC/HDL cholesterol while positively with HDL cholesterol. In women, respectively two (MUFA/SFA and cereals) and in men three (fruits & nuts, meat and alcohol) of the nine MDS components were related with blood lipids. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses investigating the relationship between the MDS, its components and blood lipid profiles indicate only limited influence of the Mediterranean diet on blood lipids.

The Mediterranean diet improves hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,Ryan MC; Itsiopoulos C; Thodis T; Ward G; Trost N; Hofferberth S; O'Dea K; Desmond PV; Johnson NA; Wilson AM,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to 30% of the population and signifies increased risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Therapies are limited. Weight loss is of benefit but is difficult to maintain. We aimed at examining the effect of the Mediterranean diet (MD), a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids, on steatosis and insulin sensitivity, using gold standard techniques. METHODS: Twelve non-diabetic subjects (6 Females/6 Males) with biopsy-proven NAFLD were recruited for a randomised, cross-over 6-week dietary intervention study. All subjects undertook both the MD and a control diet, a low fat-high carbohydrate diet (LF/HCD), in random order with a 6-week wash-out period in- between. Insulin sensitivity was determined with a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study and hepatic steatosis was assessed with localized magnetic resonance (1)H spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). RESULTS: At baseline, subjects were abdominally obese with elevated fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, ALT, and GGT. Insulin sensitivity at baseline was low (M=2.7 ± 1.0 mg/kg/min(-1)). Mean weight loss was not different between the two diets (p=0.22). There was a significant relative reduction in hepatic steatosis after the MD compared with the LF/HCD: 39 ± 4% versus 7 ± 3%, as measured by (1)H-MRS (p=0.012). Insulin sensitivity improved with the MD, whereas after the LF/HCD there was no change (p=0.03 between diets). CONCLUSIONS: Even without weight loss, MD reduces liver steatosis and improves insulin sensitivity in an insulin-resistant population with NAFLD, compared to current dietary advice.

Link of dietary patterns with metabolic syndrome: analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.,Mazidi M; Pennathur S; Afshinnia F,"BACKGROUND: Population-based interventions aimed at halting the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) require thorough understanding of dietary interplays. Objective is to identify the independent dietary nutrients associated with MetS and its components using dietary pattern identification and the single-nutrient approaches in The United States. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observation. Participants are selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with available dietary intake, biochemical and anthropometrical data from 2001 to 2012. Exposure is diet obtained from 24-h dietary recall. Main outcome measure is MetS and its components. RESULTS: Overall, 23 157 eligible individuals including 6561 with MetS were included in the final analysis. Using principle component analysis, we identified three food patterns that explained 50.8% of the variance of the dietary nutrient consumption. The highest quartile of the factor score representative of saturated/monounsaturated fatty acids or the first dietary pattern was associated with 1.27-fold (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.46, P=0.001) higher odds of association with MetS when compared with the first quartile. The second pattern representative of vitamins and trace elements had an odds ratio of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70-0.89, P<0.001) for association with MetS, and the third pattern representative of polyunsaturated fatty acids did not have any association with MetS.

"Nutritional associations with bone loss during the menopausal transition: evidence of a beneficial effect of calcium, alcohol, and fruit and vegetable nutrients and of a detrimental effect of fatty acids.",Macdonald HM; New SA; Golden MH; Campbell MK; Reid DM,"BACKGROUND: The menopausal transition is characterized by rapid bone loss. Few data exist on the role of nutrition. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to ascertain which dietary factors influence perimenopausal skeletal loss. DESIGN: A longitudinal study was conducted of 891 women aged 45-55 y at baseline and 50-59 y at follow-up 5-7 y later. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN). Nutrient intakes were assessed after the baseline visit and 5 y later, by using the same food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: After adjustment for energy intake and other confounders, higher intakes of calcium were correlated with change in FN BMD (ie, reduced loss) (r = 0.073, P < 0.05), and the intake of modest amounts of alcohol was associated with less lumbar spine bone loss (P < 0.01 for quartile of alcohol intake). Greater FN BMD loss was associated with increased intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = -0.110, P < 0.01), monounsaturated fatty acids (r = -0.069, P < 0.05), retinol (r = -0.067; P < 0.05), and vitamin E (r = -0.110; P < 0.01). The latter 2 nutrients were highly correlated with polyunsaturated fatty acids. For premenopausal women, calcium and nutrients found in fruit and vegetables (vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium) were associated with FN BMD, and calcium, vitamin C, and magnesium were associated with change in FN BMD.

METHODS: Nineteen non-obese male outpatients with triglycerides ranging from 2.30 to 9.94 mmol/l received two consecutive diets for 3 weeks each: first a modified high-fat diet (39% total fat, 8% SFA, 15% monounsaturated fatty acids, 1.6% marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids), and then a low-fat diet (total fat 28%, carbohydrates 54%). RESULTS: The high-fat diet significantly decreased triglycerides (-63%), total cholesterol (-22%), VLDL cholesterol (-54%), LDL cholesterol ( 16%), total apoC-III (-27%), apoC-III in apoB containing lipoproteins (apoC-III LpB; -31%) and in HDL (apoC-III nonLpB; -29%), apoE in serum (-33%) and apoB-containing lipoproteins (nonHDL-E; -42%), LpA-I (-16%), insulin (-36%), and leptin (-26%) and significantly increased the means of HDL cholesterol (+8%), LDL size (+6%), lipoprotein lipase (LPL, +11%), hepatic lipase (+13%), and lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT, +2%). The subsequent low-fat diet increased triglycerides (+63%), VLDL cholesterol (+19%), apoC-III (+23%), apoC-III LpB (+44%) apoC-III nonLpB (+17%), apoE (+29%) and nonHDL-E (+43%), and decreased HDL cholesterol (-12%), LPL (-3%), and LCAT (-3%). Changes in triglycerides correlated with changes in LPL activity and insulin levels. CONCLUSIONS: In hypertriglyceridemic patients, a modified diet rich in mono- and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is more effective than a carbohydrate-rich low-fat diet in correcting the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype.",2000,Oct,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,24,10,1286-96,,10.1038/sj.ijo.0801440,11093290,#9826,Pieke 2000,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Associations between the dietary inflammatory index with obesity and body fat in male adolescents.,Gholamalizadeh M; Ahmadzadeh M; BourBour F; Vahid F; Ajami M; Majidi N; Hajipour A; Doaei S; Kalantari N; Alizadeh A; Jarrahi AM,"BACKGROUND: Obesity and body composition may be affected by the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory components of diets. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and body fat percentage (BF%) in male adolescents. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 535 adolescent boys in Tehran, Iran. Bio-impedance analyzer (BIA) scale was used to measure body mass index (BMI) and body composition. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to measure DII. RESULTS: Participants with higher BF% (≥ 19.2%) had higher BMI (P < 0.001), DII, and intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), compared with the participants with lower BF%. Participants with a lower DII had significantly higher intakes of fibers (P < 0.001) and lower intakes of fats, SFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), oleic acid and linoleic acid (P < 0.05) compared with the participants with higher DII (P < 0.01). High BF% was positively associated to DII (OR = 1.6, CI 95%: 1.1-2.3, P = 0.019). Adjustments for age, BMI, physical activity, mothers' marital status and educational level and the number of siblings did not change the results. CONCLUSIONS: Following a diet with a low inflammatory index score was associated to lower BF% in male adolescents. Thus, a diet rich in anti-inflammatory factors may effectively improve body composition and prevent obesity in adolescents. Further comprehensive studies are necessary to verify these findings and to identify the underlying mechanisms.",2022,May,BMC Endocr Disord,22,1,115,,10.1186/s12902-022-01001-x,35501761,#9873,Gholamalizadeh 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Dietary and plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein profiles among elderly Hispanics and non-Hispanics and their association with diabetes.",Bermudez OI; Velez-Carrasco W; Schaefer EJ; Tucker KL,"BACKGROUND: There are limited data about dietary intakes and plasma lipids of elderly US Hispanics. OBJECTIVE: The disparity in prevalence of type 2 diabetes among population groups underscored our need to assess dietary and plasma risk factors for cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: Plasma lipids and apolipoproteins and dietary intakes of macronutrients were measured in elderly subjects (60-98 y): 490 Hispanics of Caribbean origin (Puerto Ricans and Dominicans) and 163 non-Hispanic whites. Plasma values were related to ethnicity and to macronutrient intake. Differences in plasma lipids due to diabetes were assessed among the Hispanics. RESULTS: Intakes of carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher and intakes of cholesterol and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were lower in Hispanics than in non-Hispanic whites. Concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I were significantly lower among Hispanic women than among non-Hispanic white women; a similar trend was seen in men. Dyslipidemia (high triacylglycerols and low HDL cholesterol) was more prevalent among Hispanics with than without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic differences in serum lipids exist and appear to be associated with differences in dietary intakes. However, both Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites had lipid profiles indicating a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Hispanics with diabetes were at higher risk of dyslipidemia than were those without diabetes. Our data suggest that lifestyle changes, including diet modification and exercise, could be of significant benefit to both ethnic groups.",2002,Dec,Am J Clin Nutr,76,6,1214-21,,10.1093/ajcn/76.6.1214,12450885,#9879,Bermudez 2002,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
High saturated fatty acid intake induces insulin secretion by elevating gastric inhibitory polypeptide levels in healthy individuals.,Itoh K; Moriguchi R; Yamada Y; Fujita M; Yamato T; Oumi M; Holst JJ; Seino Y,"Insulin resistance is central to the etiology of the metabolic syndrome cluster of diseases. Evidence suggests that a high-fat diet is associated with insulin resistance, which may be modulated by dietary fatty acid composition. We hypothesized that high saturated fatty acid intake increases insulin and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) secretion. To clarify the effect of ingested fatty acid composition on glucose levels, we conducted an intervention study to investigate the insulin and plasma GIP responses in 11 healthy women, including a dietary control. Subjects were provided daily control meals (F-20; saturated fatty acids/monounsaturated fatty acids/polyunsaturated fatty acids [S/M/P] ratio, 3:4:3) with 20 energy (E) % fat, followed by 2 isoenergetic experimental meals for 7 days each. These meals comprised 60 E% carbohydrate, 15 E% protein, and 30 E% fat (FB-30; high saturated fatty acid meal; S/M/P, 5:4:1; F-30: reduced saturated fatty acid meal; S/M/P, 3:4:3). On the second day of the F-20 and the last day of F-30 and FB-30, blood samples were taken before and 30, 60, and 120 minutes after a meal tolerance test. The plasma glucose responses did not differ between F-20 and FB-30 or F-30. However, insulin levels were higher after the FB-30 than after the F-20 (P < .01). The GIP response after the FB-30 was higher than that after the F-30 (P < .05). In addition, the difference in the incremental GIP between FB-30 and F-30 correlated significantly and positively with that of the insulin. These results suggest that a high saturated fatty acid content stimulates postprandial insulin release via increased GIP secretion.",2014,Aug,Nutr Res,34,8,653-60,,10.1016/j.nutres.2014.07.013,25172378,#9886,Itoh 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Increasing the percentage of energy from dietary sugar, fats, and alcohol in adults is associated with increased energy intake but has minimal association with biomarkers of cardiovascular risk.",Austin GL; Krueger PM,"The optimal diet composition to prevent obesity and its complications is unknown. Study aims were to determine the association of diet composition with energy intake, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Data were from the NHANES for eligible adults aged 20-74 y from 2005 to 2006 (n = 3073). Energy intake and diet composition were obtained by dietary recall. HOMA-IR was calculated from fasting insulin and glucose concentrations, and CRP was measured directly. Changes for a 1-point increase in percentage of sugar, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and alcohol were determined across their means in exchange for a 1-point decrease in percentage of nonsugar carbohydrates. Regression analyses were performed, and means ± SEs were estimated. Increasing the percentage of sugar was associated with increased energy intake in men (23 ± 5 kcal; P < 0.001) and women (12 ± 3 kcal; P = 0.002). In men, increasing percentages of SFAs (58 ± 13 kcal; P = 0.001) and PUFAs (66 ± 19 kcal; P < 0.001) were associated with increased energy intake. In women, increasing percentages of SFAs (27 ± 10 kcal; P = 0.02), PUFAs (43 ± 6 kcal; P < 0.001), and MUFAs (36 ± 13 kcal; P = 0.01) were associated with increased energy intake. Increasing the percentage of alcohol was associated with increased energy intake in men (38 ± 7 kcal; P < 0.001) and women (25 ± 8 kcal; P = 0.001). Obesity was associated with increased HOMA-IR and CRP in both genders (all P ≤ 0.001). Increasing PUFAs was associated with decreasing CRP in men (P = 0.02). In conclusion, increasing the percentage of calories from sugar, fats, and alcohol was associated with substantially increased energy intake but had minimal association with HOMA-IR and CRP.",2013,Oct,J Nutr,143,10,1651-8,,10.3945/jn.113.180067,23946345,#9887,Austin 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of dietary fat modification on insulin sensitivity and on other risk factors of the metabolic syndrome--LIPGENE: a European randomized dietary intervention study.,Tierney AC; McMonagle J; Shaw DI; Gulseth HL; Helal O; Saris WH; Paniagua JA; Gołąbek-Leszczyñska I; Defoort C; Williams CM; Karsltröm B; Vessby B; Dembinska-Kiec A; López-Miranda J; Blaak EE; Drevon CA; Gibney MJ; Lovegrove JA; Roche HM,"BACKGROUND: Excessive energy intake and obesity lead to the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) may be particularly detrimental on insulin sensitivity (SI) and on other components of the MetS. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the relative efficacy of reducing dietary SFA, by isoenergetic alteration of the quality and quantity of dietary fat, on risk factors associated with MetS. DESIGN: A free-living, single-blinded dietary intervention study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: MetS subjects (n = 417) from eight European countries completed the randomized dietary intervention study with four isoenergetic diets distinct in fat quantity and quality: high-SFA; high-monounsaturated fatty acids and two low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate (LFHCC) diets, supplemented with long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs) (1.2 g per day) or placebo for 12 weeks. SI estimated from an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was the primary outcome measure. Lipid and inflammatory markers associated with MetS were also determined. RESULTS: In weight-stable subjects, reducing dietary SFA intake had no effect on SI, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, inflammation or blood pressure in the entire cohort. The LFHCC n-3 PUFA diet reduced plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations (P < 0.01), particularly in men. CONCLUSION: There was no effect of reducing SFA on SI in weight-stable obese MetS subjects.

Dietary fat intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in women.,Salmerón J; Hu FB; Manson JE; Stampfer MJ; Colditz GA; Rimm EB; Willett WC,"BACKGROUND: The long-term relations between specific types of dietary fat and risk of type 2 diabetes remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the relations between dietary fat intakes and the risk of type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: We prospectively followed 84204 women aged 34-59 y with no diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer in 1980. Detailed dietary information was assessed at baseline and updated in 1984, 1986, and 1990 by using validated questionnaires. Relative risks of type 2 diabetes were obtained from pooled logistic models adjusted for nondietary and dietary covariates. RESULTS: During 14 y of follow-up, 2507 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were documented. Total fat intake, compared with equivalent energy intake from carbohydrates, was not associated with risk of type 2 diabetes; for a 5% increase in total energy from fat, the relative risk (RR) was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.02). Intakes of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids were also not significantly associated with the risk of diabetes. However, for a 5% increase in energy from polyunsaturated fat, the RR was 0.63 (0.53, 0.76; P < 0.0001) and for a 2% increase in energy from trans fatty acids the RR was 1.39 (1.15, 1.67; P = 0.0006). We estimated that replacing 2% of energy from trans fatty acids isoenergetically with polyunsaturated fat would lead to a 40% lower risk (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that total fat and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid intakes are not associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in women, but that trans fatty acids increase and polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce risk. Substituting nonhydrogenated polyunsaturated fatty acids for trans fatty acids would likely reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes substantially.",2001,Jun,Am J Clin Nutr,73,6,1019-26,,10.1093/ajcn/73.6.1019,11382654,#9902,Salmerón 2001,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Effects of dietary fat content, saturated fatty acids, and fish oil on eicosanoid production and hemostatic parameters in normal men.",Nordøy A; Hatcher L; Goodnight S; Fitzgerald GA; Conner WE,"Populations that consume a diet rich in marine lipids have been reported to have a lower risk of coronary heart disease. However, some Western population groups with a high fish consumption continue to suffer elevated rates of coronary heart disease. Many of these individuals consume a diet rich in saturated fats in addition to the fish. To examine these possible dietary interactions we fed six healthy men diets that contained two levels of saturated fat (5% and 19% of energy). During 3-week periods the study subjects were given diets with a low-(25% of energy) and high-(39% of energy) fat content with and without inclusion of n-3 polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids (2% of energy). The effects of the n-3 fatty acids on the principal plasma lipid fractions were similar regardless of the saturated fat intake. Platelet function, as measured by the skin bleeding time, was inhibited when n-3 fatty acids were added to the low saturated-fat diet. In vivo thromboxane A2 production as assessed by urinary metabolites also declined (p < 0.01) during supplementation with n-3 fatty acids to a low-fat diet. Prostacyclin production were reduced on a low-fat diet compared to a high-fat diet regardless of supplementation with n-3 fatty acids. N-3 fatty acids stimulated the synthesis of modest amounts of thromboxane A3 and prostacyclin I3, on both the low and high saturated-fat diets. These studies showed that the effects of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids on platelet and vascular function and eicosanoid production are modulated by the content of saturated fatty acids in the diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,Jun,J Lab Clin Med,123,6,914-20,,,8201271,#9903,Nordøy 1994,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary meat and fat intake and prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis in pregnant Japanese women: baseline data from the Kyushu Okinawa Maternal and Child Health Study.,Miyake Y; Tanaka K; Okubo H; Sasaki S; Arakawa M,"BACKGROUND: Dietary fat exerts numerous complex effects on proinflammatory and immunologic pathways. Several epidemiological studies have examined the relationships between intake of fatty acids and/or foods high in fat and allergic rhinitis, but have provided conflicting findings. The current cross-sectional study investigated such relationships in Japan. METHODS: Study subjects were 1745 pregnant women. The definition of rhinoconjunctivitis was based on criteria from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Information on dietary factors was collected using a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire. Adjustment was made for age; gestation; region of residence; number of older siblings; number of children; smoking; secondhand smoke exposure at home and at work; family history of asthma, atopic eczema, and allergic rhinitis; household income; education; and body mass index. RESULTS: The prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis in the past 12 months was 25.9%. Higher meat intake was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis: the adjusted odds ratio between extreme quartiles was 1.71 (95% confidence interval: 1.25-2.35, P for trend = 0.002). No measurable association was found between fish intake and rhinoconjunctivitis. Intake of total fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and cholesterol and the ratio of n-3 to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake were not evidently related to the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis.

Long-term consumption of a mediterranean diet or a low-fat diet on kidney function in coronary heart disease patients: The CORDIOPREV randomized controlled trial.,Podadera-Herreros A; Alcala-Diaz JF; Gutierrez-Mariscal FM; Jimenez-Torres J; Cruz-Ares S; Arenas-de Larriva AP; Cardelo MP; Torres-Peña JD; Luque RM; Ordovas JM; Delgado-Lista J; Lopez-Miranda J; Yubero-Serrano EM,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lifestyle and dietary habits influence kidney function, playing an important role in the prevention and development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet in preserving kidney function has been seen in primary prevention. However, no scientific evidence is currently available to determine which dietary pattern is more effective in the management of CKD in secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the long-term consumption of two healthy dietary patterns (a Mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) compared to a low-fat diet rich in complex carbohydrates) in preserving kidney function in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. METHODS: CHD patients (n = 1002) from the CORDIOPREV study were randomized to follow a Mediterranean diet (35% fat, 22% MUFA, <50% carbohydrates) or a low-fat diet (28% fat, 12% MUFA, >55% carbohydrates). Kidney function was assessed by the determination of serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and after 5-years of dietary intervention. Patients were classified according to their type 2 diabetes (T2DM) status, using baseline eGFR (normal eGFR: ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2); mildly-impaired eGFR: 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2), severely-impaired eGFR: <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) to evaluate its influence on the progression of kidney function. Multiple linear regression analysis were performed to determine the contribution of different clinical and anthropometric parameters to changes in eGFR. RESULTS: Although eGFR declined after both dietary interventions compared to baseline (all p < 0.001), the Mediterranean diet produced a lower decline of eGFR compared to the low-fat diet in patients with T2DM (p = 0.040). This effect was also observed when the overall population was considered (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed in eGFR between the two diets in non-T2DM patients. In addition, this differential effect of the Mediterranean diet was mainly observed in patients with mildly-impaired eGFR in which this diet slowed eGFR progression (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term consumption of a Mediterranean diet rich in EVOO, when compared to a low-fat diet, may preserve kidney function, as shown by a reduced decline in eGFR in CHD patients with T2DM. Patients with mildly-impaired eGFR may benefit more from the beneficial effect of the consumption of the Mediterranean diet in preserving kidney function. These findings reinforce the clinical benefits of the Mediterranean diet in the context of secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.

Relationship of the Reported Intakes of Fat and Fatty Acids to Body Weight in US Adults.,Raatz SK; Conrad Z; Johnson LK; Picklo MJ; Jahns L,"Dietary fat composition may modulate energy expenditure and body weight. Little is known about the relationship between fatty acid intake and body weight at a population level. The purposes of this study were to compare intakes of energy, macronutrients, and individual fatty acids across BMI categories (1) for the US adult population and, (2) by sociodemographic groups. Reported dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and What We Eat in America (WWEIA) surveys in the years 2005-2012 were analyzed. Overall, we found that the reported intake of carbohydrate, protein, total fat, total saturated fat (as well as long-chain saturated fatty acids 14:0-18:0), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were positively associated with BMI; while lauric acid (a medium-chain saturated fatty acid, 12:0) and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (as well as all individual PUFAs) were not associated with BMI. Non-Hispanic black individuals demonstrated a negative association between BMI and energy intake and a positive association between total PUFAs, linoleic acid (LA), α-linolenic acid (ALA) and BMI. Individuals with less than a high school education showed a negative association between BMI and DHA. Mexican-Americans reported intakes with no association between BMI and energy, any macronutrient, or individual fatty acids. These findings support those of experimental studies demonstrating fatty acid-dependent associations between dietary fatty acid composition and body weight. Notably, we observed divergent results for some sociodemographic groups which warrant further investigation.",2017,Apr,Nutrients,9,5,,,10.3390/nu9050438,28452961,#9962,Raatz 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Maternal dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids modifies the relationship between lead levels in bone and breast milk.,Arora M; Ettinger AS; Peterson KE; Schwartz J; Hu H; Hernández-Avila M; Tellez-Rojo MM; Wright RO,"Whereas dietary fats are known to influence bone mineral density, little is known about their effect on the skeletal stores of lead that are a pervasive source of fetal and infant lead exposure from heightened mobilization during pregnancy and lactation. This cross-sectional study examined the potential influence of maternal dietary intake of saturated and unsaturated fats on the relationship of lead levels in bone and breast milk during lactation. Lead was measured in blood, breast milk, and bone (patella and tibia) at 1 mo postpartum in 310 women in Mexico City. Dietary nutrient intake was assessed using a validated FFQ. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to study the influence of dietary saturated and unsaturated fats on the association between bone and breast milk lead. In multivariate models that included both the dietary intake of SFA and PUFA, an interquartile range increase in patella lead [approximately 20 microg/g (0.097 micromol/g)] was associated with a 24% (95% CI = 5-43) higher increase in breast milk lead in women in the lowest tertile of PUFA intake compared with those in the highest tertile of PUFA intake. Monounsaturated fatty acids did not modify the relationship between lead levels in patella and breast milk.

METHODS: The dietary composition of 1264 meals (398 breakfasts, 441 lunches and 425 dinners) was assessed by 7-day food records completed by 25 individuals with type 1 diabetes on HCLSs (12 men/13 women, mean ± SD age 40 ± 12 years, mean ± SD HbA(1c) 51 ± 10 mmol/mol [6.9 ± 0.2%]). For each meal, PGR (continuous glucose monitoring metrics, glucose incremental AUCs) and insulin doses (pre-meal boluses, post-meal microboluses automatically delivered by the pump and adjustment boluses) over 6 h were evaluated. RESULTS: Breakfast, lunch and dinner significantly differed with respect to energy and nutrient intake and insulin doses. The blood glucose postprandial profile showed an earlier peak after breakfast and a slow increase until 4 h after lunch and dinner (p < 0.001). Mean ± SD postprandial time in range (TIR) was better at breakfast (79.3 ± 22.2%) than at lunch (71.3 ± 23.9%) or dinner (70.0 ± 25.9%) (p < 0.001). Significant negative predictors of TIR at breakfast were total energy intake, per cent intake of total protein and monounsaturated fatty acids, glycaemic load and absolute amounts of cholesterol, carbohydrates and simple sugars consumed (p < 0.05 for all). No significant predictors were detected for TIR at lunch. For TIR at dinner, a significant positive predictor was the per cent intake of plant proteins, while negative predictors were glycaemic load and intake amounts of simple sugars and carbohydrate (p < 0.05 for all).

Dietary Intake of Fatty Acids and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer: A Case-Control Study.,Li D; Zheng J; Hatia R; Hassan M; Daniel CR,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological findings on dietary fat intake and risk of pancreatic cancer (PanC) are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the association between types of dietary fat intake and PanC. METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study in 957 pathologically confirmed PanC cases and 938 cancer-free controls. Cases and controls were frequency matched by age, sex, and race. Dietary information was collected using a self-administered validated FFQ. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the ORs and 95% CIs of PanC risk by quintiles of fat intake with the lowest quintile as referent and with adjustment for other risk factors and dietary factors. RESULTS: We observed no difference in (median) intake of total fat standardized for energy among cases versus controls. The multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) of the highest versus the lowest quintile of intake (ORQ5 compared with Q1) was 2.51 (1.68-3.72) for fat from animal sources and 0.41 (0.29-0.58) for fat from plant sources. Intakes of total MUFA, total PUFA, and linoleic (n-6) and long chain n-3 fatty acids were inversely associated with PanC (ORQ5 compared with Q1 and 95% CI: 0.55 [0.36-0.82], 0.59 [0.42-0.82], 0.64 [0.43-0.84], and 0.60 [0.42-0.84], respectively). Arachidonic acid (n-6) and several SFAs were positively associated with PanC.

Fluidity of the dietary fatty acid profile and risk of coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke: Results from the EPIC-Netherlands cohort study.,Sluijs I; Praagman J; Boer JMA; Verschuren WMM; van der Schouw YT,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The fluidity of dietary fatty acids consumed has been suggested to inversely affect coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Lipophilic index (LI) represents overall fluidity of the dietary fatty acid profile. Lipophilic load (LL) represents a combination of overall fluidity and absolute intake of dietary fatty acids. We investigated the relations of dietary LI and LL with risk of CHD and ischemic stroke (iStroke). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used data from the prospective EPIC-NL study, including 36,520 participants aged 20-70 years. LI and LL were calculated using dietary intake data estimated with a validated FFQ. Incident CHD (n = 2348) and iStroke (n = 479) cases were obtained through linkage to national registers during 15 years follow-up. LI and LL were not associated with CHD risk (HRs(highest-versus-lowest-quartiles): 0.93 [95%CI: 0.83, 1.04], and 0.92 [95%CI: 0.79, 1.07], respectively), and neither with iStroke risk (HRs 1.15 (95%CI: 0.89, 1.48), and 0.98 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.38), respectively). Original fatty acid classes (SFA, MUFA and PUFA), and LI and LL stratified by these fatty acid classes, were overall not related to CHD and ischemic stroke either. CONCLUSIONS: In this Dutch population, neither the overall fluidity of the dietary fatty acid profile (LI), nor the combined fluidity and amount of fatty acids consumed (LL) were related to CHD or iStroke risk. Dietary LI and LL may have limited added value above original fatty acid classes and food sources in establishing the relation of fatty acid consumption with CVD.",2017,Sep,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,27,9,799-805,,10.1016/j.numecd.2017.06.008,28739187,#10004,Sluijs 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
PUFAs acutely affect triacylglycerol-derived skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake and increase postprandial insulin sensitivity.,Jans A; Konings E; Goossens GH; Bouwman FG; Moors CC; Boekschoten MV; Afman LA; Müller M; Mariman EC; Blaak EE,"BACKGROUND: Dietary fat quality may influence skeletal muscle lipid processing and fat accumulation, thereby modulating insulin sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the acute effects of meals with various fatty acid (FA) compositions on skeletal muscle FA processing and postprandial insulin sensitivity in obese, insulin-resistant men. DESIGN: In a single-blind, randomized, crossover study, 10 insulin-resistant men consumed 3 high-fat mixed meals (2.6 MJ), which were high in SFAs, MUFAs, or PUFAs. Fasting and postprandial skeletal muscle FA processing was examined by measuring differences in arteriovenous concentrations across the forearm muscle. [²H₂]Palmitate was infused intravenously to label endogenous triacylglycerol and FFAs in the circulation, and [U-¹³C]palmitate was added to the meal to label chylomicron-triacylglycerol. Skeletal muscle biopsy samples were taken to assess intramuscular lipid metabolism and gene expression. RESULTS: Insulin and glucose responses (AUC) after the SFA meal were significantly higher than those after the PUFA meal (P = 0.006 and 0.033, respectively). Uptake of triacylglycerol-derived FAs was lower in the postprandial phase after the PUFA meal than after the other meals (AUC₆₀₋₂₄₀; P = 0.02). The fractional synthetic rate of the triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and phospholipid pool was higher after the MUFA meal than after the SFA meal. PUFA induced less transcriptional downregulation of oxidative pathways than did the other meals. CONCLUSION: PUFAs reduced triacylglycerol-derived skeletal muscle FA uptake, which was accompanied by higher postprandial insulin sensitivity, a more transcriptional oxidative phenotype, and altered intramyocellular lipid partitioning and may therefore be protective against the development of insulin resistance.",2012,Apr,Am J Clin Nutr,95,4,825-36,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01466816,10.3945/ajcn.111.028787,22338035,#10022,Jans 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Consumption of whole grains is associated with improved diet quality and nutrient intake in children and adolescents: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004.,O'Neil CE; Nicklas TA; Zanovec M; Cho SS; Kleinman R,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of consumption of whole grains (WG) with diet quality and nutrient intake in children and adolescents. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data. SETTING: The 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. SUBJECTS: Children aged 2-5 years (n 2278) and 6-12 years (n 3868) and adolescents aged 13-18 years (n 4931). The participants were divided into four WG consumption groups: ≥ 0 to < 0·6, ≥ 0·6 to < 1·5, ≥ 1·5 to < 3·0 and ≥ 3·0 servings/d. Nutrient intake and diet quality, using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005, were determined for each group from a single 24 h dietary recall. RESULTS: The mean number of servings of WG consumed was 0·45, 0·59 and 0·63 for children/adolescents at the age of 2-5, 6-12 and 13-18 years, respectively. In all groups, HEI and intakes of energy, fibre, vitamin B6, folate, magnesium, phosphorus and iron were significantly higher in those consuming ≥ 3·0 servings of WG/d; intakes of protein, total fat, SFA and MUFA and cholesterol levels were lower. Intakes of PUFA (6-12 years), vitamins B1 (2-5 and 13-18 years), B2 (13-18 years), A (2-5 and 13-18 years) and E (13-18 years) were higher in those groups consuming ≥ 3·0 servings of WG/d; intakes of added sugars (2-5 years), vitamin C (2-5 and 6-12 years), potassium and sodium (6-12 years) were lower.

"Intake of Different Types of Fatty Acids in Infancy Is Not Associated with Growth, Adiposity, or Cardiometabolic Health up to 6 Years of Age.",Stroobant W; Braun KV; Kiefte-de Jong JC; Moll HA; Jaddoe VW; Brouwer IA; Franco OH; Voortman T,"Background: Studies in adults indicate that a lower saturated and higher unsaturated fat intake is associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. However, studies on fat intake in relation to cardiometabolic health during childhood are scarce.Objective: We examined associations between dietary intake of fatty acids (FAs) at age 1 y and measures of growth, adiposity, and cardiometabolic health up to age 6 y.Methods: This study was conducted in 2927 children participating in the Generation R Study, a multiethnic, prospective, population-based cohort in the Netherlands. We measured children's total fat intake and intakes of saturated FAs (SFAs), monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) at a median age of 12.9 mo (95% range: 12.2, 18.9 mo) with a food-frequency questionnaire. We repeatedly measured their height and weight up to age 6 y. At 6 y of age, we measured body fat percentage, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and serum insulin, triacylglycerol, and HDL cholesterol. These outcomes were combined into a cardiometabolic risk factor score. We examined associations of FA intake with repeated measures of height, weight, and body mass index by using linear mixed models and with cardiometabolic outcomes by using linear regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and taking into account macronutrient substitution effects.Results: In multivariable models, we observed no associations of a higher intake of total fat or SFAs, MUFAs, or PUFAs with growth, adiposity, or cardiometabolic health when fat was consumed at the expense of carbohydrates. In subsequent models, there were also no associations observed for higher MUFA or PUFA intakes at the expense of SFAs with any of the outcomes. Results did not differ by sex, ethnicity, age, or birth weight.Conclusion: The results of this study did not support our hypothesis that intake of different types of FAs was associated with adiposity or cardiometabolic health among children.",2017,Mar,J Nutr,147,3,413-420,,10.3945/jn.116.241018,28122928,#10029,Stroobant 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary intervention with 2 different fat profiles; role of the rs822393 variant in metabolic parameter changes.,Aller R; Izaola O; Primo Martín D; Martínez JA; de Luis Román D,"Introduction: rs822393 is related to dietary intervention responses. The aim of our study was to analyze the metabolic effects of 2 hypocaloric diets with a different fat profile during 3 months according to the genetic variant rs822393. Methods: a population of 361 obese patients were randomly allocated to one of two diets; Diet P (enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids) vs. Diet M (enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids). Adiposity and biochemical parameters were determined. rs822393 was assessed by real-time PCR, with a dominant model analysis (CC vs CT+TT). Results: genotype distribution was: 221 CC (61.2 %), 115 CT (31.9 %) and 25 TT (6.9 %). Basal and post-intervention HDL cholesterol, adiponectin levels and adiponectin/leptin ratio were lower in T-allele than non-T-allele carriers. After both diets, BMI, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, insulin levels, HOMA-IR, leptin, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol improved significantly in both genotype groups. After Diet P, HDL-cholesterol (delta: 5.6 ± 1.1 mg/dl vs. 2.7 ± 0.9 mg/dl; p = 0.01), serum adiponectin (20.1 ± 2.9 ng/dl vs. 6.8 ± 3.0 ng/dl; p = 0.02) and adiponectin/leptin ratio (0.57 ± 0.1 units vs. 0.20 ± 0.08 units; p = 0.03) improved in non-T allele carriers. The same improvements were observed after Diet M: HDL-cholesterol (delta: 5.5 ± 0.8 mg/dl vs. 3.1 ± 0.9 mg/dl; p = 0.03), serum adiponectin (19.5 ± 2.9 ng/dl vs. 4.5 ± 2.8 ng/dl; p = 0.01), and adiponectin/leptin ratio (0.54 ± 0.1 units vs. 0.15 ± 0.08 units; p = 0.03). These parameters remained unchanged in T-allele carriers.

"Effects of unsaturated fat dietary supplements on blood lipids, and on markers of malnutrition and inflammation in hemodialysis patients.",Ewers B; Riserus U; Marckmann P,"OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of commercially available unsaturated fat dietary supplements on blood lipids, and on markers of malnutrition and inflammation, in an adult population of hemodialysis (HD) patients. DESIGN: This was a restricted, randomized (equal blocks), investigator-blinded 2x6 week crossover trial, without a washout interval. SETTING: This study was conducted at the Department of Nephrology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev, Denmark, in spring 2007. PATIENTS: Participants included 40 (30 males and 10 females) stable, adult patients undergoing regular HD, with a mean age of 64.6 years and a mean body mass index of 23.3kg/m(2). INTERVENTION: In addition to patients' habitual diets, oral unsaturated fat supplements (90mL of Calogen [SHS International, Ltd., Liverpool, UK] and 4 capsules of Pikasol [Dansk Droge, Ishoej, Denmark]) were given in one period, whereas no supplements were given in the other. Dietary supplements contributed 1.8 MJ (430kcal), 47g fat, 26.5g monounsaturated fatty acids, and 3g marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids per day. Blood sampling and nutritional assessments were performed at baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intakes, blood lipids, dry body weight, serum albumin, and serum C-reactive protein comprised our main outcome measures. RESULTS: According to a per-protocol analysis of 14 study completers, fat supplementation resulted in significantly increased total energy intake (+1.6 MJ/day, or 380kcal/day) and an increased dietary fat energy percentage (+9%). We observed no significant changes in blood lipids. Dry body weight (+0.49kg, P=.04) increased, and serum C-reactive protein concentration fell (-1.69mg/L, P=.01), with fat supplementation. Intention-to-treat analysis of 39 participants confirmed the absence of adverse blood-lipid changes. CONCLUSIONS: Unsaturated fat supplementation increased total dietary energy intake to recommended levels, had no adverse impact on blood lipids, improved nutritional status as assessed according to dry body weight, and reduced systemic inflammation as assessed according to C-reactive protein serum concentrations.

Alternate Mediterranean diet score is positively associated with skeletal muscle mass index in middle-aged adults.,Tian HY; Qiu R; Jing LP; Chen ZY; Chen GD; Chen YM,"Researches have suggested Mediterranean diet might lower the risk of chronic diseases, but data on skeletal muscle mass (SMM) are limited. This community-based cross-sectional study examined the association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score (aMDS) and SMM in 2230 females and 1059 males aged 40-75 years in Guangzhou, China. General information and habitual dietary information were assessed in face-to-face interviews conducted during 2008-2010 and 3 years later. The aMDS was calculated by summing the dichotomous points for the items of higher intakes of whole grain, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, fish and ratio of MUFA:SFA, lower red meat and moderate ethanol consumption. The SMM of the whole body, limbs, arms and legs were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry during 2011-2013. After adjusting for potential covariates, higher aMDS was positively associated with skeletal muscle mass index (SMI, SMM/height2, kg/m2) at all of the studied sites in males (all P trend<0·05). The multiple covariate-adjusted SMI means were 2·70 % (whole body), 2·65 % (limbs), 2·50 % (arms) and 2·70 % (legs) higher in the high (v. low) category aMDS in males (all P<0·05). In females, the corresponding values were 1·35 % (P trend=0·03), 1·05, 0·52 and 1·20 %, (P trend>0·05). Age-stratified analyses showed that the favourable associations tended to be more pronounced in the younger subjects aged less than the medians of 59·2 and 62·2 years in females and males (P interaction>0·10).

A recent report comprehensively concluded that total energy intake does not have a simple relationship with CRC risk, and that the data were inconsistent for carbohydrate, cholesterol and protein. The objective of this study was to identify the associations of CRC risk with dietary intakes of total energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, and alcohol using data from a large case-control study conducted in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) and Ontario (ON), Canada. METHODS: Incident colorectal cancer cases (n = 1760) were identified from population-based cancer registries in the provinces of ON (1997-2000) and NL (1999-2003). Controls (n = 2481) were a random sample of residents in each province, aged 20-74 years. Family history questionnaire (FHQ), personal history questionnaire (PHQ), and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were used to collect study data. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of intakes of total energy, macronutrients and alcohol with CRC risk. RESULTS: Total energy intake was associated with higher risk of CRC (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.21-2.01, p-trend = 0.02, 5th versus 1st quintile), whereas inverse associations emerged for intakes of protein (OR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.69-1.00, p-trend = 0.06, 5th versus 1st quintile), carbohydrate (OR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.63-1.00, p-trend = 0.05, 5th versus 1st quintile) and total dietary fiber (OR: 0.84, 95% CI:0.67-0.99, p-trend = 0.04, 5th versus 1st quintile). Total fat, alcohol, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol were not associated with CRC risk. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that high energy intake may increase risk of incident CRC, whereas diets high in protein, fiber, and carbohydrate may reduce the risk of the disease.",2012,Mar,Nutr J,11,,18,,10.1186/1475-2891-11-18,22449145,#10110,Sun 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether a close adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet improves endothelial function in individuals with AO. DESIGN: We recruited 90 subjects with AO without cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Both groups were instructed to follow a Mediterranean-style diet for 2 mo. Subjects in the intervention group additionally had to follow a specific relevant daily and weekly food plan with close supervision by a dietitian and provision of basic foods. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), and insulin resistance with the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) were measured. RESULTS: After 2 mo, subjects in the intervention group increased their intake of total fat due to higher consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids as well as intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and alcohol compared with the control group (all P < 0.05). The intervention group also increased FMD ( 2.05%; 95% CI: 0.97, 3.13%), whereas no effect was found in the control group (-0.32%; 95% CI: -1.31, 0.67%). Changes in lipids and CRP concentrations did not differ between the 2 groups, whereas diastolic blood pressure decreased in the intervention group (-6.44 mm Hg; 95% CI: -8.57, -4.31 mm Hg) compared with the control group (-0.76 mm Hg; 95% CI: -2.83, 1.31 mm Hg).

Dietary fat quality has been proposed to be implicated in these conditions. We investigated the impact of four diets distinct in fat quantity and quality on 8-iso-PGF2α (a major F2-isoprostane and oxidative stress indicator), 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGF2α (15-keto-dihydro-PGF2α, a major PGF2α metabolite and marker of cyclooxygenase-mediated inflammation) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In a 12-week parallel multicentre dietary intervention study (LIPGENE), 417 volunteers with the MetS were randomly assigned to one of the four diets: two high-fat diets (38 % energy (%E)) rich in SFA or MUFA and two low-fat high-complex carbohydrate diets (28 %E) with (LFHCC n-3) or without (LFHCC) 1·24 g/d of very long chain n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Urinary levels of 8-iso-PGF2α and 15-keto-dihydro-PGF2α were determined by RIA and adjusted for urinary creatinine levels. Serum concentration of CRP was measured by ELISA.

Glycemic and blood lipid profiles were measured by standardized methods. Genotyping of the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA polymorphism was performed by the RFLP method. Gene-diet interactions regarding anthropometric and metabolic phenotypes were screened by adjusted multiple linear regression analyses. Genotype frequencies of the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA polymorphism were A1A1 (16.0%), A1A2 (52.6%), and A2A2 (31.4%). Statistically significant interactions between the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA genotypes and dietary factors in relation to blood triglyceride (TG) levels were found. Carriers of the A1 allele (A1A1 homozygotes plus A1A2 heterozygotes) were protected from TG increases by maltose intake (P int. = 0.023). Instead, A2A2 homozygotes were susceptible to TG rises through consumptions of total fat (P int. = 0.041), monounsaturated fatty acids (P int. = 0.001), and dietary cholesterol (P int. = 0.019).

All patients were genotyped rs3774261 and evaluated in a dominant model (AA vs. GA+AA). RESULTS: Genotype frequencies were 46 (34.6%) AA, 66 (49.6%) AG, and 21 (15.8%) GG. After dietary intervention and in both genotypes, BMI, weight, fat mass, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and leptin decreased. In patients with the AA genotype, there was a significant improvement at (3 and 9 months) in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (-10.1±0.9 mg/dl vs. -5.6±1.7 mg/dl, p=0.01) (-19.1±0.9 mg/dl vs. -6.9±0.7 mg/dl, p=0.03), total cholesterol (-9.4±0.8 mg/dl vs. -5.8±0.9 mg/dl, p=0.02) (-17.4±1.8 mg/dl vs. -9.8±1.9 mg/dl, p=0.02), triglycerides (-12.3±0.8 mg/dl vs. -8.0±0.9 mg/dl, p=0.01) (-26.1±0.8 mg/dl vs. -11.0±0.3 mg/dl, p=0.01), C reactive protein (CRP) (-0.8±0.2 mg/ dl vs. -0.4± 0.3 mg/dl, p=0.01) (-1.1±0.2 mg/ dl vs. -0.7±0.1 mg/dl, p=0.01) and adiponectin (28.2±11.1 ng/ml vs. 4.1±2.8 ng/ml, p=0.02) (30.1±8.1 ng/ml vs. 7.1±4.8 ng/ml, p=0.02). Finally, higher values of adiponectin and adiponectin/leptin ratio were detected at 3- and 9-months post-treatment in patients with AA genotype. CONCLUSIONS: G allele carriers of ADIPOQ gene variant (rs3774261) showed no improvement in serum levels of adiponectin, adiponectin/leptin ratio, total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and CRP after weight loss with a hypocaloric fat monounsaturated diet.",2023,Aug,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,27,16,7597-7606,,10.26355/eurrev_202308_33412,37667937,#10131,deLuis 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Fatty acid quality and quantity of diet and risk of type 2 diabetes in adults: Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.,Mirmiran P; Esfandyari S; Moghadam SK; Bahadoran Z; Azizi F,"AIM: Studies suggest that fatty acid intake may be an important determinant of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aims to prospectively examine the association between fatty acid quantity and quality with risk of T2DM in adults. METHODS: In this community-based prospective sample, 2139 adults, free of T2DM, aged 20-70y-old were followed for a median of 5.8 y. Diet information was collected with the use of a validated questionnaire at baseline. Cox regression and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, diabetes risk score (DRS), and dietary intakes of energy, fiber and magnesium, were used to evaluate the association of fatty acid intakes with incident T2DM. RESULTS: During follow-up, we identified 143 incident T2D cases. In multivariable analyses, when extreme quintiles were compared, cholesterol (HR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.20-0.82; P-trend, 0.02), monounsaturated fatty acids (HR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.13-0.70; P-trend, 0.02), polyunsaturated fatty acids (HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24-0.93 P-trend = 0.04) and ω-3 fatty acids (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31-0.88; P-trend = 0.02) were associated with T2DM. The ratio of ω-6 to total ω-3 intake was associated with a higher risk of T2D (HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.05-2.86; P-trend, 0.04). We also found positive associations between the ratios of total fat to ω-3 (HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.02-2.46; P-trend = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that diets with high cholesterol, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and ω-3 fatty acids are associated with a lower risk of T2DM. Also the ratios of ω-6/ω-3 and total fat/ω-3 were positively associated with T2DM.",2018,Jul,J Diabetes Complications,32,7,655-659,,10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2018.05.003,29853261,#10136,Mirmiran 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"A randomised four-intervention crossover study investigating the effect of carbohydrates on daytime profiles of insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids and triacylglycerols in middle-aged men.",Brynes AE; Mark Edwards C; Ghatei MA; Dornhorst A; Morgan LM; Bloom SR; Frost GS,"Postprandial concentrations of glucose, insulin and triacylglycerols (TG) correlate to risk for CHD. Carbohydrates affect many metabolites that could have a potential effect on cardiovascular risk factors. The objective of the present study was to examine, using a randomised prospective study, the acute (day 1) and ad libitum medium-term (day 24) effects of four diets: a high-fat diet (HIGH-FAT; 50 % fat, >34 % monounsaturated fatty acids); a low-glycaemic index (GI) diet (LOW-GI; high-carbohydrate, low-GI); a high-sucrose diet (SUCROSE; high carbohydrate increase of 90 g sucrose/d); a high-GI diet (HIGH-GI; high-carbohydrate, high-GI). Daytime profiles (8 h) (breakfast, lunch and tea) of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were completed during day 1 and day 24. Seventeen middle-aged men with one or more cardiac risk factors completed the study. There was no change from day 1 or between diets in fasting glucose, lipids or homeostatic assessment model (HOMA) on day 24. The HIGH-FAT compared with the three high-carbohydrate diets was associated with lower postprandial insulin and glucose but higher postprandial TG and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). There was a significant increase in the 6 h (15.00 hours) TG concentration (day 1, 2.6 (sem 0.3) mmol/l v. day 24, 3.3 (sem 0.3) mmol/l; P<0.01) on the SUCROSE diet. Postprandial HOMA (i.e. incremental area under the curve (IAUC) glucose (mmol/l per min)xIAUC insulin/22.5 (mU/l per min)) median changes from day 1 to day 24 were -61, -43, -20 and +31 % for the HIGH-FAT, LOW-GI, SUCROSE and HIGH-GI diets respectively. The HIGH-GI percentage change was significantly different from the other three diets (P<0.001). Despite being advised to maintain an identical energy intake there was a significant weight change (-0.27 (sem 0.3) kg; P<0.02) on the LOW-GI diet compared with the SUCROSE diet (+0.84 (sem 0.3) kg). In conclusion the HIGH-FAT diet had a beneficial effect on postprandial glucose and insulin over time but it was associated with higher postprandial concentrations of TG and NEFA. Conversely the HIGH-GI diet appeared to increase postprandial insulin resistance over the study period.",2003,Feb,Br J Nutr,89,2,207-18,,10.1079/BJN2002769,12575905,#10140,Brynes 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Nutrient patterns and their relation to obesity and metabolic syndrome in Iranian overweight and obese adult women.,Yarizadeh H; Setayesh L; Majidi N; Rasaei N; Mehranfar S; Ebrahimi R; Casazzza K; Mirzaei K,"PURPOSE: Nutrient patterns have been associated with an increased risk for chronic disease. Evidence to confirm a direct relationship between nutrient patterns and obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) throughout population-based differences including cultural contexts add complexity is not well established yet. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between nutrient patterns and MetS among overweight and obese Iranian women. METHODS: Three hundred and sixty obese and overweight women (25 < BMI < 40) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Dietary intake of 19 nutrients was evaluated by a semi-quantitative standard food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). MetS was determined by abdominal obesity > 88 (cm) in females, Triglycerides ≥ 150 (mg/dL), dyslipidemia (HDL < 50 mg/dL), systolic blood pressure > 130/85 (millimeters), and glucose > 100 (mg/dL). Body composition was assessed by a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer, InBody 770 scanner. Principle components analysis was applied and four nutrient patterns were identified as following: Pattern 1 (thiamin, iron, carbohydrate, zinc, niacin, protein, magnesium, phosphorus, riboflavin), represented the carbo-vitamin group. Lipid group was showed in pattern 2 (PUFAs, MUFA, vitamin E, trans fatty acids, and Pattern 3 (beta-carotene, vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C) represented the anti-oxidant group, finally Pattern 4 was the indicator of the milk group (vitamin D, calcium). RESULTS: A significant positive association was observed between the anti-oxidant group and obesity (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.09-1.8; P = 0.01). No relationship between other nutrient pattern and MetS was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The nutrient patterns that are highly loading of beta-carotene, vitamin K, vitamin A, and vitamin C in nutrient patterns may be associated to higher risk of obesity in overweight and obese Iranian women.

Associations between diet quality scores and central obesity among adults in Puerto Rico.,Riseberg E; Tamez M; Tucker KL; Rodriguez Orengo JF; Mattei J,"BACKGROUND: Adults in Puerto Rico experience an excessive burden of central obesity. It remains unknown which dietary components are more strongly associated with central obesity in this high-risk group. We aimed to evaluate the relationship of the Mediterranean diet (MeDS) and Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI) with central obesity in the Puerto Rico Assessment of Diet, Lifestyle and Diseases (PRADLAD) cross-sectional study. METHODS: Data from PRADLAD participants (ages 30-75 years) were used (n = 166). Dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. The MeDS [nine components; range: 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest observance of a Mediterranean-like diet)] and AHEI [11 components; range: 0 (lowest) to 110 (highest diet quality)] were defined. Daily intake of foods and beverages within each MeDS component was ranked by contribution to total energy intake. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between MeDS and AHEI with central obesity (waist circumference > 102 cm males, > 88 cm females). RESULTS: Mean ± SD MeDS was 4.46 ± 1.77 and AHEI was 60.2 ± 11.1. Traditional foods representative of the MeDS included potatoes, root vegetables, fruit juice, avocados, bread, oatmeal, beans, chicken, seafood, low-fat milk, cheese, eggs and beer. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of central obesity were 0.78 (0.63-0.97) per unit increment of MeDS and 0.61 (0.42-0.90) per 10-unit increment of AHEI. CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to MeDS or AHEI was associated with lower central obesity in adults in Puerto Rico.

Unsaturated Fatty Acid Intakes During Midlife Are Positively Associated with Later Cognitive Function in Older Adults with Modulating Effects of Antioxidant Supplementation.,Assmann KE; Adjibade M; Hercberg S; Galan P; Kesse-Guyot E,"BACKGROUND: Given the drastic demographic changes characterized as ""population aging,"" the disease burden related to dementia is a major public health problem. The scientific literature documenting the link between mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs, PUFAs) and cognitive function during aging is plentiful, but findings are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the association between intakes of unsaturated fatty acids at midlife and cognitive performance 13 y later in French adults, and to test for a modulating effect of antioxidant supplementation. METHODS: Fatty acid intakes were estimated with the use of repeated 24-h records (1994-1996) among 3362 subjects (mean ± SD age: 65.5 ± 4.6 y) of the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation with Antioxidant Vitamins and Minerals) study, including an intervention phase (1994-2002) during which participants were randomly assigned to an ""antioxidant supplementation"" or placebo group. Cognitive performance was assessed at follow-up only (in 2007-2009) via a battery of 6 standardized neuropsychological tests. A global cognitive score was calculated as the sum of T-scores of the 6 tests. Multivariable-adjusted regression analyses were performed to provide regression coefficients and 95% CIs. RESULTS: In multivariable models, total MUFAs, total PUFAs, and n-6 PUFAs (ω-6 PUFAs) were positively associated with overall cognitive functioning. n-3 PUFA (ω-3 PUFA) intakes showed positive associations among supplemented participants only (mean difference Tertile3 versus Tertile1: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.30, 2.51; P-trend = 0.01, P-interaction = 0.01). A detrimental role of arachidonic acid for cognitive functioning was only detected in the placebo group (mean difference Tertile3 versus Tertile1: -1.38; 95% CI: -2.57, -0.18; P-trend = 0.02, P-interaction = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Whereas higher total MUFA and n-6 PUFA intakes may be generally beneficial for maintaining cognitive health during aging, a higher consumption of n-3 fatty acids may only be beneficial among individuals with an adequate antioxidant status. These findings underline the importance of not only focusing on specific nutrients for dementia prevention, but also considering the complex interaction between consumed nutrients.

Interaction of PPARG Pro12Ala with dietary fat influences plasma lipids in subjects at cardiometabolic risk.,AlSaleh A; O'Dell SD; Frost GS; Griffin BA; Lovegrove JA; Jebb SA; Sanders TAB,"The PPARγ2 gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Pro12Ala has shown variable association with metabolic syndrome traits in healthy subjects. The RISCK Study investigated the effect of interaction between genotype and the ratio of polyunsaturated:saturated (P:S) fatty acid intake on plasma lipids in 367 white subjects (ages 30-70 years) at increased cardiometabolic risk. Interaction was determined after habitual diet at recruitment, at baseline after a 4-week high-SFA (HS) diet, and after a 24-week reference (HS), high-MUFA (HM), or low-fat (LF) diet. At recruitment, there were no significant associations between genotype and plasma lipids; however, P:S × genotype interaction influenced plasma total cholesterol (TC) (P = 0.02), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) (P = 0.002), and triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.02) concentrations. At P:S ratio ≤ 0.33, mean TC and LDL-C concentrations in Ala12 allele carriers were significantly higher than in noncarriers (respectively, P = 0.003; P = 0.0001). Significant trends in reduction of plasma TC (P = 0.02) and TG (P = 0.002) concentrations occurred with increasing P:S (respectively, ≤0.33 to >0.65; 0.34 to >0.65) in Ala12 allele carriers. There were no significant differences between carriers and noncarriers after the 4-week HS diet or 24-week interventions.

Dietary fat differentially influences regulatory endothelial function during the postprandial state in patients with metabolic syndrome: from the LIPGENE study.,Perez-Martinez P; Moreno-Conde M; Cruz-Teno C; Ruano J; Fuentes F; Delgado-Lista J; Garcia-Rios A; Marin C; Gomez-Luna MJ; Perez-Jimenez F; Roche HM; Lopez-Miranda J,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether endothelium-dependent vasomotor function and plasma levels of cellular adhesion molecules are affected by diets with different fat quantity and quality during the postprandial state in subjects with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to one of four isoenergetic diets distinct in fat quantity and quality: high-SFA (HSFA); high-MUFA (HMUFA) and two low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate (LFHCC) diets, supplemented with 1.24g/day of long chain n-3 PUFA (LC n-3 PUFA) or placebo for 12 weeks each. Flow-associated vasodilatation of the brachial artery and postprandial plasma levels of total nitrites, nitric oxide (NO) synthase, soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and P-selectin were assessed post-intervention. RESULTS: Post-intervention postprandial flow-associated vasodilatation was significantly higher after the HMUFA diet (P<0.05) compared to subjects adhering to the other three diets. Consistently, the postprandial NO synthase response significantly increased during the HMUFA compared with the HSFA and LFHCC (placebo) diets. Postprandial sICAM-1 levels were lower during the HMUFA than during the HSFA and LFHCC n-3 diets. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the notion that the HMUFA diet improves postprandial endothelial cell function and decreases postprandial plasma sICAM-1 concentrations in patients with the MetS. These findings suggest that the postprandial state is important for understanding possible cardio-protective effects associated with the Mediterranean diet particularly in subject with the MetS.",2010,Apr,Atherosclerosis,209,2,533-8,,10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.09.023,19818442,#10174,Perez-Martinez 2010,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Preferences of healthy and unhealthy foods among 3 to 4 year old children in Mexico.,De Lira-Garcia C; Bacardi-Gascon M; Jimenez-Cruz A,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the preference of healthy and unhealthy foods among pre-school children attending daycare and its association with that of their parents, body mass index and socio-demographic variables. METHODOLOGY: We asked children and parents to depict their food preferences through 54 pictures of different food items. The association between the preferences and socio-demographic variables was done using the Phi correlation, chi-squared, Fisher's correlation, as well as univariate and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Two-hundred and sixty-five parent-child pairs participated in the study. Ice cream, potato chips and lollypops were the foods most preferred by children. On the other hand, quince jelly, coffee and avocado were the least preferred. Overweight and obese children had a higher preference for quince jelly, preserved fruits, and vegetable soup. With univariate logistic regression, children of low-income homes (OR= 2.56, p=0.007) and attending public daycare centers (OR= 6.2, p=0.0001) preferred less healthy fruits. When the father's education was added in a multivariable model including family income, only children whose fathers had <=9 years of education showed a higher preference for less healthy food. When parent's education, family income, and parent's preference for healthy foods were included to the model only children attending public daycares were more likely to prefer healthy foods. CONCLUSION: The foods most preferred by children have a high caloric density. The children's body mass index, their parent's monthly income, the father's education and the type of daycare they attended were associated with the preference of healthy or unhealthy foods.",2012,,Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,21,1,57-63,,,22374561,#10185,DeLira-Garcia 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong outcomes; ,
Phenolic compounds content and antioxidant capacity of meals provided to elementary public schools in Chile during 2011.,Lutz M; Barraza R; Henríquez C,"The Chilean National School Feeding Program (NSFP) delivers breakfast and lunch meals that supply 250 and 450 kcal, respectively, along the country. In the last decades, a significant increase of obesity has been observed in primary education children, and it involves risk factors of non-communicable diseases. The dietary intake of foods containing phenolic compounds (PC) exerts favorable effects on health by reducing risk factors of prevalent diseases. The aim of the study was to measure the PC content and antioxidant capacity (AC) [ORAC and DPPH] of meals provided by the NSFP in Quillota, Chile, in 2011. The PC supply of the whole meals served ranged from 362.7 to 1,730 mg GAE. The best breakfast foods include whole grain cookie (2.59 ± 0.3 mg GAE/g), bread with avocado, quince jelly or strawberry jam (1.61 ± 0.13 to 2.05 ± 0.3 mg GAE/g); while the best lunch salads include beetroot, lettuce, and cabbage/fish (1.66 ± 0.3 to 2.35 ± 0.1 mg GAE/g), and main courses contain legumes, or mixed vegetables. The lowest PC contents were observed in pasta and rice preparations (p < 0.05). Among desserts, the best source of PC is fruit (1.81 ± 0.04 to 6.91 ± 0.31 mg GAE/g). The correlation between PC and AC varied according to the type of meal. PC content and AC are additional criteria for selecting the best quality meals, in addition to the nutrients and energy content.

Maternal fatty acid intake and fetal growth: evidence for an association in overweight women.

The objective was to study the association between fatty acid intake and fetal growth in pregnant French women. Pregnant women included in the EDEN mother-child cohort study completed FFQ on their usual diet: (1) in the year before pregnancy and (2) during the last 3 months of pregnancy (n 1439). Conversion into nutrient intakes was performed using data on portion size and a French food composition table. Associations between maternal fatty acid intakes and several neonatal anthropometric measurements were studied using linear regressions adjusted for centre, mother's age, smoking habits, height, parity, gestational age and newborn's sex. Due to significant interaction, analyses were stratified according to maternal pre-pregnancy overweight status. Neither total lipid nor SFA, MUFA or PUFA intake was significantly associated with newborn size. In overweight women only (n 366), a high pre-pregnancy n-3 fatty acid intake (% PUFA) was positively associated with the newborn's birth weight (P=0.01), head, arm and wrist circumferences and sum of skinfolds (P<0.04). A substitution of 1% of n-3 fatty acids per d before pregnancy by other PUFA was related to an average decrease in birth weight of 60 g (P=0.01). Relationships with n-3 fatty acid intake at the end of pregnancy were weaker and not significant. We concluded that a high pre-pregnancy n-3 fatty acid:PUFA ratio may sustain fetal growth in overweight women.

Identification of a dietary pattern characterized by high-fat food choices associated with increased risk of breast cancer: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam Study.,Schulz M; Hoffmann K; Weikert C; Nöthlings U; Schulze MB; Boeing H,"Epidemiological studies conducted thus far have mainly used a single-nutrient approach which may not be sufficient in detecting diet-cancer relationships. The aim of the study was to examine the association of a food pattern based on explained variations in fatty acid intake by means of reduced rank regression with breast cancer risk. Study participants were female subjects (n 15,351) of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam Study free of cancer at baseline and with complete dietary and outcome information followed for an average of 6.0 years. Among those, 137 incident cases of invasive breast cancer were identified. We identified a food pattern characterized by low consumption of bread, and fruit juices, and high consumption of processed meat, fish, butter and other animal fats, and margarine explaining >42 % of total variation in fatty acid intake (SFA, MUFA, n-3 PUFA, n-6 PUFA). Intake of all four fatty acid fractions was positively associated with the pattern score. Adherence to this food pattern adjusted for covariates was associated with a two-fold risk (hazard ratio 2.00; 95 % CI 1.30, 3.09) of breast cancer comparing extreme tertiles of the pattern score. There was no evidence of effect modification by menopausal status, overweight status and use of hormone replacement therapy, respectively. In conclusion, a food pattern characterized by high-fat food choices was significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer.

The association between dietary saturated fatty acids and ischemic heart disease depends on the type and source of fatty acid in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Netherlands cohort.,Praagman J; Beulens JW; Alssema M; Zock PL; Wanders AJ; Sluijs I; van der Schouw YT,"BACKGROUND: The association between saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk is debated. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether dietary SFAs were associated with IHD risk and whether associations depended on 1) the substituting macronutrient, 2) the carbon chain length of SFAs, and 3) the SFA food source. DESIGN: Baseline (1993-1997) SFA intake was measured with a food-frequency questionnaire among 35,597 participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Netherlands cohort. IHD risks were estimated with multivariable Cox regression for the substitution of SFAs with other macronutrients and for higher intakes of total SFAs, individual SFAs, and SFAs from different food sources. RESULTS: During 12 y of follow-up, 1807 IHD events occurred. Total SFA intake was associated with a lower IHD risk (HR per 5% of energy: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.93). Substituting SFAs with animal protein, cis monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), or carbohydrates was significantly associated with higher IHD risks (HR per 5% of energy: 1.27-1.37). Slightly lower IHD risks were observed for higher intakes of the sum of butyric (4:0) through capric (10:0) acid (HRSD: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.99), myristic acid (14:0) (HRSD: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.97), the sum of pentadecylic (15:0) and margaric (17:0) acid (HRSD: 0.91: 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99), and for SFAs from dairy sources, including butter (HRSD: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99), cheese (HRSD: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97), and milk and milk products (HRSD: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In this Dutch population, higher SFA intake was not associated with higher IHD risks. The lower IHD risk observed did not depend on the substituting macronutrient but appeared to be driven mainly by the sums of butyric through capric acid, the sum of pentadecylic and margaric acid, myristic acid, and SFAs from dairy sources. Residual confounding by cholesterol-lowering therapy and trans fat or limited variation in SFA and PUFA intake may explain our findings.

METHODS: The prospective Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Study included children with genetic susceptibility to T1D born between 1996 and 2004. Participants were followed up every 3 to 12 months up to 6 years for diet, islet autoantibodies, and T1D. Dietary intake of several fatty acids at the age of 3 months to 6 years was assessed 1-8 times per participant with a 3-day food record. Joint models adjusted for energy intake, sex, HLA genotype and familial diabetes were used to investigate the associations of longitudinal intake of fatty acids and the development of islet autoimmunity and T1D. RESULTS: During the 6-year follow-up, 247 (4.4%) children of 5626 developed islet autoimmunity and 94 (1.7%) children of 5674 developed T1D. Higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.47, 0.82), arachidonic acid (0.69; 0.50, 0.94), total n-3 fatty acids (0.64; 0.48, 0.84), and long-chain n-3 fatty acids (0.14; 0.04, 0.43), was associated with a decreased risk of islet autoimmunity with and without energy adjustment. Higher intake of total fat (0.73; 0.53, 0.98), and saturated fatty acids (0.55; 0.33, 0.90) was associated with a decreased risk of T1D only when energy adjusted. CONCLUSION: Intake of several fatty acids was associated with a decreased risk of islet autoimmunity or T1D among high-risk children. Our findings support the idea that dietary factors, including n-3 fatty acids, may play a role in the disease process of T1D.",2023,Mar,Eur J Nutr,62,2,847-856,,10.1007/s00394-022-03035-2,36284022,#10241,Hakola 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Serum cholesterol levels in children are associated with dietary fat and fatty acid intake.,Nicklas TA; Dwyer J; Feldman HA; Luepker RV; Kelder SH; Nader PR,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies in adults suggest that individual dietary fatty acids differ markedly in their effects on serum lipids and lipoprotein levels. However, these associations have rarely been studied in children. OBJECTIVE: To assess, using regression procedures, the associations in children between specific fatty acids and nonfasting serum lipids and cholesterol after controlling for total energy and total fat intake, SUBJECTS: The sample consisted of 1,182 children who participated in the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health. The sample was equally distributed across 4 sites (Louisiana, Texas, Minnesota, California). The sample was 48% boys; 71% white, 15% Hispanic-American, 10% African-American, 2% Asian, and 2% from other or unspecified racial/ethnic heritage. DESIGN: In this randomized multicenter trial with 56 intervention and 40 control elementary schools, food record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls and serum lipid measurements were collected for each child at baseline (3rd grade) and at the 5th grade follow-up. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the association between nutrient composition of the diet and serum lipids. Independent dietary variables included amount and type of fat, individual fatty acids, protein, carbohydrate, and fiber. The dependent variables were the absolute values of serum total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) both at baseline (3rd grade) and at follow-up (5th grade). RESULTS: Increased total fat (b=0.053; P<.03) was associated with increased TC in the model when energy was held constant, whereas increased carbohydrate was associated with decreased TC (b=-0.021, P<.02) and HDL-C (b=-0.010, P<.005) levels. Increased total protein (b=0.017, P<.05) was associated with increased HDL-C when energy was held constant. Saturated fat (b=0.004, P<.04), unsaturated fat (b=0.004, P<.03), and myristic fatty acid (b=0.021, P<.01) all increased TC in the model when total fat and total energy were held constant. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATIONS: We conclude that using a modeling approach, the effect of diet on serum lipids in children is similar to that observed in adults. Total fat and saturated fat were positively associated with TC and HDLC levels, saturated fat was positively associated with TC, and carbohydrate was inversely associated with both TC and HDL-C. In the statistical model, substitution of unsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, or oleic acid for saturated fat, while holding total fat and energy constant, slightly lowered TC. In contrast, substitution of total fat for carbohydrate in the model increased TC and, thus, did not seem to be associated with an apparent health advantage except for HDL-C elevating effects. However, consumption of individual fats tends to be highly correlated, and we were unable to determine if these biological effects were operating independently.",2002,Apr,J Am Diet Assoc,102,4,511-7,,10.1016/s0002-8223(02)90117-3,11985407,#10244,Nicklas 2002,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women in northern Tanzania: a case-control study.,Jordan I; Hebestreit A; Swai B; Krawinkel MB,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It was tested within a case-control study in this region whether a specific dietary pattern impacts on the breast cancer risk. METHODS: A validated semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to assess the dietary intake of 115 female breast cancer patients and 230 healthy age-matched women living in the same districts. A logistic regression was performed to estimate breast cancer risk. Dietary patterns were obtained using principal component analysis with Varimax rotation. RESULTS: The adjusted logistic regression estimated an increased risk for a ""Fatty Diet"", characterized by a higher consumption of milk, vegetable oils and fats, butter, lard and red meat (OR = 1.42, 95 % CI 1.08-1.87; P = 0.01), and for a ""Fruity Diet"", characterized by a higher consumption of fish, mango, papaya, avocado and watery fruits (OR = 1.61, 95 % CI 1.14-2.28; P = 0.01). Both diets showed an inverse association with the ratio between polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids (P/S ratio).

Correlation of spinal epidural fat volume with body mass index: a longitudinal study.,Rigsby RK; Barnes S; Sabaté J; Oyoyo U; Chowdhury S; Peters EM,"PURPOSE: Spinal epidural lipomatosis is abnormal accumulation of normal fat in the epidural space with weight loss suggested as first-line therapy in select symptomatic patients. However, moderate to large longitudinal studies establishing concordant changes between body mass index and epidural fat are lacking. The purpose of this study was to longitudinally assess this relationship. METHODS: We performed an ancillary study of the Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial. Baseline and six-month abdominal MRIs were analyzed for 98 overweight or obese but otherwise healthy subjects. Dorsal epidural fat volumes in the lumbar spine were measured and correlated with changes in body mass index, changes in visceral fat volume, and demographic information. RESULTS: There was a linear relationship between body mass index changes and epidural fat volume changes with a one-point change in body mass index corresponding to a 45 mm(3) change in dorsal epidural fat volume (p < 0.001, 95% CI 31.87 to 76.77) as well as between visceral fat volume changes and epidural fat volume changes (regression coefficient 0.51, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.47). Age was inversely related with subjects older than 45.7 years tending to lose epidural fat (regression coefficient -0.22, p = 0.025, 95% CI -10.43 to -0.72). CONCLUSION: Changes in spinal dorsal epidural fat volume parallel changes in body mass index and visceral fat, supporting weight loss as initial treatment for uncomplicated obesity-associated spinal epidural lipomatosis.",2023,Jun,Clin Imaging,98,,61-66,,10.1016/j.clinimag.2023.03.015,37004496,#10287,Rigsby 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong study type; ,

This study compared diet preferences and oral microbiota profiles in patients with PD vs. healthy controls. This study compared the oral microbiota composition of 59 patients with PD and 108 healthy controls (without neurodegeneration) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. According to results, oral microbiota in patients with PD is different compared from healthy controls. In particular, decreased abundance of Proteobacteria, Pastescibacteria, and Tenercutes was observed. The oral cavity of patients with PD was characterized by the high relative abundance of bacteria from the genera Prevotella, Streptococcus, and Lactobaccillus. There were also differences in food preferences between patients with PD and healthy controls, which revealed significantly higher intake of margarine, fish, red meat, cereals products, avocado, and olives in the patients with PD relative to healthy controls.

The effect of increased fruit and vegetable consumption on selected macronutrient and micronutrient intakes in four randomised-controlled trials.,Fulton SL; McKinley MC; Neville CE; Baldrick FR; Mulligan C; McCall DO; McCance DR; Edgar JD; Elborn JS; Young IS; Patterson CC; Woodside JV,"Fruit and vegetable (FV) intake is associated with reduced risk of a number of non-communicable diseases. Research tends to focus on antioxidants, flavonoids and polyphenols contained in FV as the main beneficial components to health; however, increasing FV may also alter overall diet profile. Extra FV may be substituted for foods thought to be less healthy, therefore altering the overall macronutrient and/or micronutrient content in the diet. This analysis merged dietary data from four intervention studies in participants with varying health conditions and examined the effect of increased FV consumption on diet profile. Dietary intake was assessed by either diet diaries or diet histories used in four FV randomised intervention studies. All food and drink intake recorded was analysed using WISP version 3.0, and FV portions were manually counted using household measures. Regression analysis revealed significant increases in intakes of energy (172 kJ (+41 kcal)), carbohydrate (+3·9 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), total sugars (+6·0 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) and fibre (+0·8 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) and significant decreases in intakes of total fat (-1·4 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), SFA (-0·6 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), MUFA (-0·6 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), PUFA (-0·1 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) and starch (-2·1 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) per one portion increase in FV. Significant percentage increases were also observed in vitamin C (+24 %) and -carotene (+20 %) intake, per one portion increase in FV. In conclusion, pooled analysis of four FV intervention studies, that used similar approaches to achieving dietary change, in participants with varying health conditions, demonstrated an increase in energy, total carbohydrate, sugars and fibre intake, and a decrease in fat intake alongside an expected increase in micronutrient intake.",2017,May,Br J Nutr,117,9,1270-1278,,10.1017/S0007114517001088,28535825,#10299,Fulton 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fat quantity and quality modifies advanced glycation end products metabolism in patients with metabolic syndrome.,Lopez-Moreno J; Quintana-Navarro GM; Camargo A; Jimenez-Lucena R; Delgado-Lista J; Marin C; Tinahones FJ; Striker GE; Roche HM; Perez-Martinez P; Lopez-Miranda J; Yubero-Serrano EM,"SCOPE: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) increase in dysmetabolic conditions. Lifestyle, including diet, has shown be effective in preventing the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). We investigated whether AGE metabolism is affected by diets with different fat quantity and quality in MetS patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized, controlled trial assigned 75 MetS patients to one of four diets: high SFA (HSFA), high MUFA (HMUFA), and two low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets (LFHCC) supplemented with long-chain n-3 PUFA or placebo for 12-weeks each. Dietary and serum AGE [methylglyoxal (MG: lysine-MG-H1) and N-carboxymethyllysine] levels and gene expression related to AGE metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (AGER1, RAGE, GloxI, and Sirt1 mRNA) were determined. HMUFA diet reduced serum AGE (sAGE) and RAGE mRNA, increased AGER1 and GloxI mRNA levels compared to the other diets. LFHCC n-3 diet reduced sAGE levels and increased AGER1 mRNA levels compared to LFHCC and HSFA diets. Multiple regression analyses showed that sMG and AGER1 mRNA appeared as significant predictors of oxidative stress/inflammation-related parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Low AGE content in HMUFA diet reduces sAGEs and modulates the gene expression related to AGE metabolism in MetS patients, which may be used as a therapeutic approach to reduce the incidence of MetS and related chronic diseases.",2017,Aug,Mol Nutr Food Res,61,8,,,10.1002/mnfr.201601029,28233454,#10300,Lopez-Moreno 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

Evidence show dietary patterns may be associated with cognitive status in older adults. This cross-sectional study investigated associations between dietary patterns and cognitive function in older adults in New Zealand. METHODS: The REACH study (Researching Eating, Activity, and Cognitive Health) included 371 participants (65-74 years, 36% male) living independently in Auckland, New Zealand. Valid and reproducible dietary patterns were derived, using principal component analysis, from dietary data collected by a 109-item validated food frequency questionnaire. Six cognitive domains (global cognition, attention and vigilance, executive function, episodic memory, working memory, and spatial memory) were tested using COMPASS (Computerised Mental Performance Assessment System). Associations between dietary patterns and cognitive scores, adjusted for age, sex, education, physical activity, energy, and Apolipoprotein E-ε4 status were analysed using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Three dietary patterns explained 18% of dietary intake variation-'Mediterranean style' (comprising: salad vegetables, leafy cruciferous vegetables, other vegetables, avocados and olives, alliums, nuts and seeds, white fish and shellfish, oily fish, and berries); 'Western' (comprising: processed meats, sauces and condiments, cakes, biscuits and puddings, meat pies and chips, and processed fish); and 'Prudent' (comprising: dried legumes, soy-based foods, fresh and frozen legumes, whole grains, and carrots). No associations between any cognitive domain and dietary pattern scores were observed. Global cognitive function was associated with being younger and having a university education.

Dietary biomarker evaluation in a controlled feeding study in women from the Women's Health Initiative cohort.,Lampe JW; Huang Y; Neuhouser ML; Tinker LF; Song X; Schoeller DA; Kim S; Raftery D; Di C; Zheng C; Schwarz Y; Van Horn L; Thomson CA; Mossavar-Rahmani Y; Beresford SA; Prentice RL,"BACKGROUND: Controlled human feeding studies are necessary for robust nutritional biomarker development and validation. Previous feeding studies have typically evaluated single nutrients and tested relatively few diets. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were 1) to simultaneously associate dietary intake with a range of potential nutritional biomarkers in postmenopausal women by using a controlled feeding study whereby each participant was provided a diet similar to her usual diet and 2) to evaluate serum concentrations of select nutrients as potential biomarkers with the use of established urinary recovery biomarkers of energy and protein as benchmarks for evaluation. DESIGN: Postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative (n = 153) were provided with a 2-wk controlled diet in which each individual's menu approximated her habitual food intake as estimated from her 4-d food record and adjusted for estimated energy requirements. Serum biomarkers, including carotenoids, tocopherols, folate, vitamin B-12, and phospholipid fatty acids, were collected at the beginning and end of the feeding period. Doubly labeled water and urinary nitrogen biomarkers were used to derive estimates of energy and protein consumption, respectively. RESULTS: Linear regression of (ln-transformed) consumed nutrients on (ln-transformed) potential biomarkers and participant characteristics led to the following regression (R(2)) values for serum concentration biomarkers: folate, 0.49; vitamin B-12, 0.51; α-carotene, 0.53; β-carotene, 0.39; lutein + zeaxanthin, 0.46; lycopene, 0.32; and α-tocopherol, 0.47. R(2) values for percentage of energy from polyunsaturated fatty acids and urinary recovery biomarkers of energy and protein intakes were 0.27, 0.53, and 0.43, respectively. Phospholipid saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids and serum γ-tocopherol were weakly associated with intake (R(2) < 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentration biomarkers of several vitamins and carotenoids performed similarly to established energy and protein urinary recovery biomarkers in representing nutrient intake variation in a feeding study, and thus are likely suitable for application in this population of postmenopausal women.

Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARγ2 gene interacts with a mediterranean diet to prevent telomere shortening in the PREDIMED-NAVARRA randomized trial.,García-Calzón S; Martínez-González MA; Razquin C; Corella D; Salas-Salvadó J; Martínez JA; Zalba G; Marti A,"BACKGROUND: The gene variant Pro/Ala (rs1801282) in the PPARγ2 has been associated with lower cardiovascular risk and greater benefit from lifestyle interventions. This polymorphism also seems to be associated with longer lifespan, but no information on telomere length (TL) is available. Our aim was to study the association between the Ala allele and changes in TL in high cardiovascular risk subjects and the potential interaction with a Mediterranean dietary pattern. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 521 subjects (55-80 years) participating in the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea randomized trial were genotyped. Changes in TL, measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were assessed over 5 years of a nutritional intervention, which promoted adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet). Interestingly, Ala carriers showed lower telomere shortening after 5 years compared with the Pro/Pro genotype (P=0.031). This association was modulated by MeDiet because those Ala carriers who reported better conformity to the MeDiet exhibited increased TL (P<0.001). Moreover, a reduction in carbohydrate intake (≤9.5 g/d) resulted in increased TL among Ala carriers. Notably, an apparent gene-diet interaction was found through the observed changes in the MUFA+PUFA/carbohydrates ratio: as this ratio increased, TL lengthening was detected to a greater extent in the Ala carriers compared with the Pro/Pro subjects (P for interaction <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Pro12Ala polymorphism is associated with TL homeostasis after 5 years follow-up in subjects at high cardiovascular risk. In addition, a higher adherence to the MeDiet pattern strengthens the prevention of telomere shortening among Ala carriers.

Diet quality and nutrient density in pregnant women according to adherence to Mediterranean diet.,Castro-Barquero S; Larroya M; Crispi F; Estruch R; Nakaki A; Paules C; Ruiz-León AM; Sacanella E; Freitas T; Youssef L; Benitez L; Casas I; Genero M; Gomez S; Casanovas-Garriga F; Gratacós E; Casas R; Crovetto F,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The dietary pattern followed during pregnancy, specifically healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet, is a key factor in the mother's and the offspring's health. Pregnant women dietary intake is not enough to cover the micronutrient requirements of pregnancy, and higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet may improve dietary quality and nutritional density. The aim of the present study was to describe the dietary nutrient intake and diet quality during pregnancy and to evaluate whether a high adherence to Mediterranean diet was associated with a more adequate intake of micronutrients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with 1,356 pregnant women selected during the routine second trimester ultrasound scan (19-23 weeks' gestation). Energy and nutrient intake were calculated using a validated 151-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and nutrient density was estimated dividing the absolute nutrient intake by total energy intake. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated with a 17-item Mediterranean diet adherence score. The criterion used for risk of inadequate nutrient intake has been set below two thirds (2/3) of the dietary reference intakes. The differences were assessed by multivariate linear regression models adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: A significant proportion of pregnant women had an inadequate intake of macro and micronutrient that was lower in those with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (≥12 points, n = 122, 19%), including calcium (the Mediterranean diet high adherence 2.5% vs. low adherence 26.7%, p < 0.001), magnesium (0% vs. 7.6%, p = 0.001), iron (24.5% vs. 74.1%, p < 0.001), and vitamin B9 (0% vs. 29.8%, p < 0.001), vitamin C (0% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.033), and vitamin D (61.5% vs. 92.8%, p < 0.001) intake. High adherence to Mediterranean diet was associated with higher intake of protein, monounsaturated fatty acids, fiber, vitamins (B1, B9, C, D), calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, phosphor, potassium, essential fatty acids, and α-linolenic acid, and with a lower intake of α-linoleic acid and trans fatty acids as compared to low adherence to Mediterranean diet. CONCLUSION: High adherence to Mediterranean diet was associated with higher diet quality and lower proportion of inadequate micro and macronutrient intake.

The aim of our study is to assess the relationship between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and plasma FAs and their subtypes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma FAs are assessed in a cross-sectional analysis of a subsample of 240 subjects from the PREDIMED-Plus study. Participants are categorized into four groups of fruit, vegetable, and fat intake according to the food frequency questionnaire. Plasma FA analysis is performed using gas chromatography. Associations between FAs and F&V consumption are adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), total energy intake, and alcohol consumption. Plasma saturated FAs are lower in groups with high F&V consumption (-1.20 mg cL(-1) [95% CI: [-2.22, -0.18], p-value = 0.021), especially when fat intake is high (-1.74 mg cL(-1) [95% CI: [-3.41, -0.06], p-value = 0.042). Total FAs and n-6 polyunsaturated FAs tend to be lower in high consumers of F&V only in the high-fat intake groups.

"A defined, plant-based diet utilized in an outpatient cardiovascular clinic effectively treats hypercholesterolemia and hypertension and reduces medications.",Najjar RS; Moore CE; Montgomery BD,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major economic burden in the United States. CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, are typically treated with drug therapy. Five-year efficacy of such drugs to prevent CVD is estimated to be 5%. Plant-based diets have emerged as effective mitigators of these risk factors. HYPOTHESIS: The implementation of a defined, plant-based diet for 4 weeks in an outpatient clinical setting may mitigate CVD risk factors and reduce patient drug burden. METHODS: Participants consumed a plant-based diet consisting of foods prepared in a defined method in accordance with a food-classification system. Participants consumed raw fruits, vegetables, seeds, and avocado. All animal products were excluded from the diet. Participant anthropometric and hemodynamic data were obtained weekly for 4 weeks. Laboratory biomarkers were collected at baseline and at 4 weeks. Medication needs were assessed weekly. Data were analyzed using paired-samples t tests and 1-way repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Significant reductions were observed for systolic (-16.6 mmHg) and diastolic (-9.1 mmHg) blood pressure (P < 0.0005), serum lipids (P ≤ 0.008), and total medication usage (P < 0.0005).

Changes in Quantity and Sources of Dietary Fiber from Adopting Healthy Low-Fat vs. Healthy Low-Carb Weight Loss Diets: Secondary Analysis of DIETFITS Weight Loss Diet Study.,Offringa LC; Hartle JC; Rigdon J; Gardner CD,"The daily intake of dietary fiber is well below the recommended levels in the US. The effect of adopting a low-fat vs. a low-carbohydrate weight loss diet on fiber intake is of interest but not well-documented, especially when both approaches promote high-quality food choices. The objective of this paper is to compare the quantity and sources of dietary fiber between a healthy low-fat (HLF) vs. healthy low-carbohydrate (HLC) diet group when consumed over 12 months in a weight loss diet study. In this secondary analysis of the Diet Intervention Examining The Factors Interacting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) study, the amount and sources of dietary fiber were examined in generally healthy adults, 18-50 years of age, Body Mass Index (BMI) 28-40 kg/m(2), randomized to HLF or HLC for 12 months, who had available 24-h recalls at 0 (n = 609), 3 (n = 549), 6 (n = 491), and 12 (n = 449) months. The dietary intake was estimated by the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R). The sources of fiber were determined for the major food groups. Significantly more total dietary fiber was consumed by HLF at every post-randomization time point, and, at 12 m, was 23.04 ± 9.43 g vs. 18.61 ± 8.12 g for HLF vs. HLC, respectively, p < 0.0001. In both diet groups at 12 months, the highest amount of dietary fiber came from non-starchy vegetables (4.13 ± 3.05 g and 5.13 ± 3.59 g). The other primary sources of fiber at 12 months for the HLF group were from whole grains (3.90 ± 3.13 g) and fruits (3.40 ± 2.87 g), and, for the HLC group, were from plant protein and fat sources, such as nuts and seeds, their butters, and avocados (2.64 ± 2.64 g). In the DIETFITS study, the difference in the total fiber intake for the HLF vs. HLC groups was more modest than expected. The HLC group consumed reasonably high amounts of fiber from high-protein and high fat plant-based sources.",2021,Oct,Nutrients,13,10,,,10.3390/nu13103625,34684626,#10479,Offringa 2021,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Lack of effect of dietary n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio on plasma lipids and markers of insulin responses in Indian Asians living in the UK.,Minihane AM; Brady LM; Lovegrove SS; Lesauvage SV; Williams CM; Lovegrove JA,"BACKGROUND: Indian Asians living in Western Countries have an over 50 % increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) relative to their Caucasians counterparts. The atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP), which is more prevalent in this ethnic group, may in part explain the increased risk. A low dietary long chain n-3 fatty acid (LC n-3 PUFA) intake and a high dietary n-6 PUFA intake and n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio in Indian Asians have been proposed as contributors to the increased ALP incidence and CHD risk in this subgroup. AIM: To examine the impact of dietary n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio on membrane fatty acid composition, blood lipid levels and markers of insulin sensitivity in Indian Asians living in the UK. METHODS: Twenty-nine males were assigned to either a moderate or high n-6:n-3 PUFA (9 or 16) diet for 6 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and 6 weeks for analysis of triglycerides, total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, insulin, markers of insulin sensitivity and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: Group mean saturated fatty acid, MUFA, n-6 PUFA and n-3 PUFA on the moderate and high n-6:n-3 PUFA diets were 26 g/d, 43 g/d, 15 g/d, 2 g/d and 25 g/d, 25 g/d, 28 g/d, 2 g/d respectively. A significantly lower total membrane n-3 PUFA and a trend towards lower EPA and DHA levels were observed following the high n-6:n-3 PUFA diet. However no significant effect of treatment on plasma lipids was evident. There was a trend towards a loss of insulin sensitivity on the high n-6:n- 3 PUFA diet, with the increase in fasting insulin (P = 0.04) and HOMA IR [(insulin x glucose)/22.5] (P = 0.02) reaching significance. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that, within the context of a western diet, it is unlikely that dietary n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio has any major impact on the levels of LC n-3 PUFA in membrane phospholipids or have any major clinically relevant impact on insulin sensitivity and its associated dyslipidemia.",2005,Feb,Eur J Nutr,44,1,26-32,,10.1007/s00394-004-0488-9,15309461,#10492,Minihane 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Boron-rich diet may regulate blood lipid profile and prevent obesity: A non-drug and self-controlled clinical trial.,Kuru R; Yilmaz S; Balan G; Tuzuner BA; Tasli PN; Akyuz S; Yener Ozturk F; Altuntas Y; Yarat A; Sahin F,"BACKGROUND: Boron is an element commonly found in nature. The main boron source for organisms is through food and drinking water. In recent years, it is suggested that the ""boron-rich diet"" can affect human health positively. However, more detailed studies are needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of increased dietary boron intake on some biochemical parameters in humans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen healthy women consumed diets containing 10 mg more boron than their routine diet for one month. This boron intake was provided with the increase of boron-rich foods such as dried fruits, avocado, and nuts in the diet. Some biochemical and hematologic parameters were determined in blood, urine and saliva samples taken before and after a boron-rich diet. RESULTS: Serum, salivary, and urine boron concentrations increased 1.3, 1.7, 6.0 fold, respectively. The most significant clinically change was found in the lipid profile. Serum total, LDL, VLDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels decreased significantly. Body weight, body fat weight, and Body Mass Index also decreased. Significant changes in serum TSH and salivary buffering capacity were also found. CONCLUSION: Increasing the intake of boron through dietary means might contribute to beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, obesity, and thyroid metabolism; salivary boron may reflect serum boron; and boron may be used as a cariostatic agent in dentistry. An increased intake of other dietary factors such as fiber, potassium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin E in the boron-rich foods might have been responsible of the effects described. To our knowledge, this study is the first clinical study in which dietary boron intake is increased via foods.",2019,Jul,J Trace Elem Med Biol,54,,191-198,,10.1016/j.jtemb.2019.04.021,31109611,#10534,Kuru 2019,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,Maybe
Mediterranean diet and endothelial function in patients with coronary heart disease: An analysis of the CORDIOPREV randomized controlled trial.,Yubero-Serrano EM; Fernandez-Gandara C; Garcia-Rios A; Rangel-Zuñiga OA; Gutierrez-Mariscal FM; Torres-Peña JD; Marin C; Lopez-Moreno J; Castaño JP; Delgado-Lista J; Ordovas JM; Perez-Martinez P; Lopez-Miranda J,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is a crucial step in atherosclerosis development, and its severity is determinant for the risk of cardiovascular recurrence. Diet may be an effective strategy to protect the endothelium, although there is no consensus about the best dietary model. The CORonary Diet Intervention with Olive oil and cardiovascular PREVention (CORDIOPREV) study is an ongoing prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial in 1,002 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, whose primary objective is to compare the effect of 2 healthy dietary patterns (low-fat versus Mediterranean diet) on the incidence of cardiovascular events. Here, we report the results of one secondary outcome of the CORDIOPREV study: to evaluate the effect of these diets on endothelial function, assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. METHODS AND FINDINGS: From the total participants taking part in the CORDIOPREV study, 805 completed endothelial function study at baseline and were randomized to follow a Mediterranean diet (35% fat, 22% monounsaturated fatty acids [MUFAs], and <50% carbohydrates) or a low-fat diet (28% fat, 12% MUFAs, and >55% carbohydrates), with endothelial function measurement repeated after 1 year. As secondary objectives and to explore different underlying mechanisms in the modulation of endothelial function, we quantified endothelial microparticles (EMPs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and evaluated, in 24 preselected patients, in vitro cellular processes related to endothelial damage (reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and senescence) and endothelial repair (cell proliferation and angiogenesis), as well as other modulators (micro-RNAs [miRNAs] and proteins). Patients who followed the Mediterranean diet had higher FMD (3.83%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.91-4.23) compared with those in the low-fat diet (1.16%; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.98) with a difference between diets of 2.63% (95% CI: 1.89-3.40, p = 0.011), even in those patients with severe endothelial dysfunction. We observed higher EPC levels (group difference: 1.64%; 95% CI: 0.79-2.13, p = 0.028) and lower EMPs (group difference: -755 EMPs/μl; 95% CI: -1,010 to -567, p = 0.015) after the Mediterranean diet compared with the low-fat diet in all patients. We also observed lower intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (group difference: 11.1; 95% CI: 2.5 to 19.6, p = 0.010), cellular apoptosis (group difference: -20.2; 95% CI: -26.7 to -5.11, p = 0.013) and senescence (18.0; 95% CI: 3.57 to 25.1, p = 0.031), and higher cellular proliferation (group difference: 11.3; 95% CI: 4.51 to 13.5, p = 0.011) and angiogenesis (total master segments length, group difference: 549; 95% CI: 110 to 670, p = 0.022) after the Mediterranean diet than the low-fat diet. Each dietary intervention was associated with distinct changes in the epigenetic and proteomic factors that modulate biological process associated with endothelial dysfunction. The evaluation of endothelial function is a substudy of the CORDIOPREV study. As in any substudy, these results should be treated with caution, such as the potential for false positives because of the exploratory nature of the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the Mediterranean diet better modulates endothelial function compared with a low-fat diet and is associated with a better balance of vascular homeostasis in CHD patients, even in those with severe endothelial dysfunction.

Intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and risk of ovarian cancer.,Ibiebele TI; Nagle CM; Bain CJ; Webb PM,"OBJECTIVES: Limited experimental evidence suggests that omega-3 polyunsaturated (n-3) fatty acids inhibit the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells in vitro, whereas omega-6 polyunsaturated (n-6) fatty acids have been shown to promote carcinogenesis, but epidemiological studies to date have been inconclusive. Our aim was to evaluate the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in ovarian carcinogenesis. METHODS: Participants in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (1,366 cases and 1,414 population controls) self-completed risk factor and food frequency questionnaires. Logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: We found no association between intake of total n-3 fatty acids from foods, or the individual n-3 fatty acids-alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic acids-and ovarian cancer risk. High intake of total n-6 fatty acids was inversely associated with risk (OR for highest vs. lowest category 0.78, 95 % CI 0.60-1.00, p-trend 0.04); however, the association was restricted to n-6 fatty acids from avocado, vegetables, and nuts. Neither higher intake of the individual n-6 fatty acids nor the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids was associated with ovarian cancer risk. We found no evidence that risk varied by supplement use. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide no evidence of a protective role for n-3 fatty acids in ovarian carcinogenesis. The benefit, if any, of higher intake of n-6 fatty acids is due to general properties of the food sources, rather than due to the n-6 fatty acids per se.",2012,Nov,Cancer Causes Control,23,11,1775-83,,10.1007/s10552-012-0053-4,22933054,#10575,Ibiebele 2012,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Association of dietary nutrients with blood lipids and blood pressure in 18 countries: a cross-sectional analysis from the PURE study.,Mente A; Dehghan M; Rangarajan S; McQueen M; Dagenais G; Wielgosz A; Lear S; Li W; Chen H; Yi S; Wang Y; Diaz R; Avezum A; Lopez-Jaramillo P; Seron P; Kumar R; Gupta R; Mohan V; Swaminathan S; Kutty R; Zatonska K; Iqbal R; Yusuf R; Mohammadifard N; Khatib R; Nasir NM; Ismail N; Oguz A; Rosengren A; Yusufali A; Wentzel-Viljoen E; Puoane T; Chifamba J; Teo K; Anand SS; Yusuf S,"BACKGROUND: The relation between dietary nutrients and cardiovascular disease risk markers in many regions worldwide is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary nutrients on blood lipids and blood pressure, two of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease, in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. METHODS: We studied 125 287 participants from 18 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. Habitual food intake was measured with validated food frequency questionnaires. We assessed the associations between nutrients (total fats, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, protein, and dietary cholesterol) and cardiovascular disease risk markers using multilevel modelling. The effect of isocaloric replacement of saturated fatty acids with other fats and carbohydrates was determined overall and by levels of intakes by use of nutrient density models. We did simulation modelling in which we assumed that the effects of saturated fatty acids on cardiovascular disease events was solely related to their association through an individual risk marker, and then compared these simulated risk marker-based estimates with directly observed associations of saturated fatty acids with cardiovascular disease events. FINDINGS: Participants were enrolled into the study from Jan 1, 2003, to March 31, 2013. Intake of total fat and each type of fat was associated with higher concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, but also with higher HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and lower triglycerides, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol, and ratio of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) to ApoA1 (all p(trend)<0·0001). Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and ApoB, but also with lower HDL cholesterol and ApoA1, and higher triglycerides, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol, and ApoB-to-ApoA1 ratio (all p(trend)<0·0001, apart from ApoB [p(trend)=0·0014]). Higher intakes of total fat, saturated fatty acids, and carbohydrates were associated with higher blood pressure, whereas higher protein intake was associated with lower blood pressure. Replacement of saturated fatty acids with carbohydrates was associated with the most adverse effects on lipids, whereas replacement of saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fats improved some risk markers (LDL cholesterol and blood pressure), but seemed to worsen others (HDL cholesterol and triglycerides). The observed associations between saturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease events were approximated by the simulated associations mediated through the effects on the ApoB-to-ApoA1 ratio, but not with other lipid markers including LDL cholesterol. INTERPRETATION: Our data are at odds with current recommendations to reduce total fat and saturated fats. Reducing saturated fatty acid intake and replacing it with carbohydrate has an adverse effect on blood lipids. Substituting saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fats might improve some risk markers, but might worsen others. Simulations suggest that ApoB-to-ApoA1 ratio probably provides the best overall indication of the effect of saturated fatty acids on cardiovascular disease risk among the markers tested. Focusing on a single lipid marker such as LDL cholesterol alone does not capture the net clinical effects of nutrients on cardiovascular risk.

Role of Metabolic Genes in Blood Aluminum Concentrations of Jamaican Children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder.,Rahbar MH; Samms-Vaughan M; Pitcher MR; Bressler J; Hessabi M; Loveland KA; Christian MA; Grove ML; Shakespeare-Pellington S; Beecher C; McLaughlin W; Boerwinkle E,Aluminum is a neurotoxic metal with known health effects in animals and humans. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) genes and enzymes play a major role in detoxification of several heavy metals. Besides a direct relationship with oxidative stress; aluminum decreases GST enzyme activities. Using data from 116 Jamaican children; age 2-8 years; with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 116 sex- and age-matched typically developing (TD) children; we investigated the association of polymorphisms in three GST genes (GSTP1; GSTM1; and GSTT1) with mean blood aluminum concentrations in children with and without ASD. Using log-transformed blood aluminum concentration as the dependent variable in a linear regression model; we assessed the additive and interactive effects of ASD status and polymorphisms in the three aforementioned GST genes in relation to blood aluminum concentrations. Although none of the additive effects were statistically significant (all p > 0.16); we observed a marginally significant interaction between GSTP1 Ile105Val (rs1695) and ASD status (p = 0.07); even after controlling for parental education level and consumption of avocado; root vegetables; and tuna (canned fish). Our findings indicate a significantly lower (p < 0.03) adjusted geometric mean blood aluminum concentration for TD children who had the Val/Val genotype (14.57 µg/L); compared with those with Ile/Ile or Ile/Val genotypes who had an adjusted geometric mean of 23.75 µg/L. However; this difference was not statistically significant among the ASD cases (p = 0.76). Our findings indicate that ASD status may be a potential effect modifier when assessing the association between GSTP1 rs1695 and blood aluminum concentrations among Jamaican children. These findings require replication in other populations.,2016,Nov,Int J Environ Res Public Health,13,11,,,10.3390/ijerph13111095,27834815,#10916,Rahbar 2016,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Changes in Intake of Fruits and Vegetables and Weight Change in United States Men and Women Followed for Up to 24 Years: Analysis from Three Prospective Cohort Studies.,Bertoia ML; Mukamal KJ; Cahill LE; Hou T; Ludwig DS; Mozaffarian D; Willett WC; Hu FB; Rimm EB,"BACKGROUND: Current dietary guidelines recommend eating a variety of fruits and vegetables. However, based on nutrient composition, some particular fruits and vegetables may be more or less beneficial for maintaining or achieving a healthy weight. We hypothesized that greater consumption of fruits and vegetables with a higher fiber content or lower glycemic load would be more strongly associated with a healthy weight. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined the association between change in intake of specific fruits and vegetables and change in weight in three large, prospective cohorts of 133,468 United States men and women. From 1986 to 2010, these associations were examined within multiple 4-y time intervals, adjusting for simultaneous changes in other lifestyle factors, including other aspects of diet, smoking status, and physical activity. Results were combined using a random effects meta-analysis. Increased intake of fruits was inversely associated with 4-y weight change: total fruits -0.53 lb per daily serving (95% CI -0.61, -0.44), berries -1.11 lb (95% CI -1.45, -0.78), and apples/pears -1.24 lb (95% CI -1.62, -0.86). Increased intake of several vegetables was also inversely associated with weight change: total vegetables -0.25 lb per daily serving (95% CI -0.35, -0.14), tofu/soy -2.47 lb (95% CI, -3.09 to -1.85 lb) and cauliflower -1.37 lb (95% CI -2.27, -0.47). On the other hand, increased intake of starchy vegetables, including corn, peas, and potatoes, was associated with weight gain. Vegetables having both higher fiber and lower glycemic load were more strongly inversely associated with weight change compared with lower-fiber, higher-glycemic-load vegetables (p < 0.0001). Despite the measurement of key confounders in our analyses, the potential for residual confounding cannot be ruled out, and although our food frequency questionnaire specified portion size, the assessment of diet using any method will have measurement error. CONCLUSIONS: Increased consumption of fruits and non-starchy vegetables is inversely associated with weight change, with important differences by type suggesting that other characteristics of these foods influence the magnitude of their association with weight change.",2015,Sep,PLoS Med,12,9,e1001878,,10.1371/journal.pmed.1001878,26394033,#11196,Bertoia 2015,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,avo intake in supplemental
Diet quality indices and changes in cognition during chemotherapy.,Crowder SL; Welniak TL; Hoogland AI; Small BJ; Rodriguez Y; Carpenter KM; Fischer SM; Li D; Kinney AY; Rotroff D; Mariam A; Brownstein N; Reich RR; Hembree T; Playdon MC; Arthur AE; Vieytes CA; Li Z; Extermann M; Kim R; Berry DL; Jim HSL,"PURPOSE: No evidence-based prevention strategies currently exist for cancer-related cognitive decline (CRCD). Although patients are often advised to engage in healthy lifestyle activities (e.g., nutritious diet), little is known about the impact of diet on preventing CRCD. This secondary analysis evaluated the association of pre-treatment diet quality indices on change in self-reported cognition during chemotherapy. METHODS: Study participants (n = 96) completed the Block Brief Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) before receiving their first infusion and the PROMIS cognitive function and cognitive abilities questionnaires before infusion and again 5 days later (i.e., when symptoms were expected to be their worst). Diet quality indices included the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), and a low carbohydrate diet index and their components. Descriptive statistics were generated for demographic and clinical variables and diet indices. Residualized change models were computed to examine whether diet was associated with change in cognitive function and cognitive abilities, controlling for age, sex, cancer type, treatment type, depression, and fatigue. RESULTS: Study participants had a mean age of 59 ± 10.8 years and 69% were female. Although total diet index scores did not predict change in cognitive function or cognitive abilities, higher pre-treatment ratio of aMED monounsaturated/saturated fat was associated with less decline in cognitive function and cognitive abilities at 5-day post-infusion (P ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher pre-treatment ratio of monounsaturated/saturated fat intake was associated with less CRCD early in chemotherapy. Results suggest greater monounsaturated fat and less saturated fat intake could be protective against CRCD during chemotherapy.",2022,Dec,Support Care Cancer,31,1,75,,10.1007/s00520-022-07513-5,36544032,#11204,Crowder 2022,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Body Fat Moderates the Association of Olfactory Dysfunction with Dietary Intake in U.S. Middle-Aged and Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of NHANES 2013-2014.,Bhutani S; McClain AC,"Background: Obesity relates to impaired olfactory function. Abnormal olfactory function is also associated with poor diet; however, whether obesity-related markers shape this relationship is unknown. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis (n = 1415, age > 40 years) of NHANES 2013−2014 examined body fat percent (BF%) and waist circumference (WC) as moderators of the relationship between olfactory function and diet. The olfactory function test identified adults with olfactory dysfunction (OD) or normal olfaction (NO). Validated 24 h recall captured nutrient intake and Healthy Eating Index-2010 scores. BF% and WC were measured. We tested adjusted linear regression models, with an interaction term between olfactory function and BF%/WC, for each nutrient or HEI score, and reported coefficients (β), standard errors (SE), and p-values for significant interaction terms. Results: In OD (9.5%; mean age 50.9 years, 95% CI 49.6, 52.2) compared with NO (mean age 49.3 years, 95% CI 48.8, 49.9), higher BF% was associated with higher intake of saturated fat (β (SE): 0.2 (0.1) g; p = 0.06) and percent of total calories from total fat (0.2 (0.1); p = 0.07), saturated (0.1 (0.004); p = 0.02), and monounsaturated fat (0.1 (0.1); p = 0.08); lower percent of total calories from carbohydrates (−0.2 (0.1); p = 0.09) and mg of sodium (−17.8 (09.6); p = 0.08); and a higher (healthier) refined grain score (0.1 (0.1); p = 0.04). Higher WC was associated with higher refined grain scores (0.01 (0.02); p = 0.01) in OD. Conclusion: BF% may shape dietary intake and quality in OD.

Associations of fat and carbohydrate intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality: prospective cohort study of UK Biobank participants.,Ho FK; Gray SR; Welsh P; Petermann-Rocha F; Foster H; Waddell H; Anderson J; Lyall D; Sattar N; Gill JMR; Mathers JC; Pell JP; Celis-Morales C,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of macronutrient intake with all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the implications for dietary advice. DESIGN: Prospective population based study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 195 658 of the 502 536 participants in UK Biobank completed at least one dietary questionnaire and were included in the analyses. Diet was assessed using Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire, and nutrient intakes were estimated using standard methodology. Cox proportional models with penalised cubic splines were used to study non-linear associations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality and incidence of CVD. RESULTS: 4780 (2.4%) participants died over a mean 10.6 (range 9.4-13.9) years of follow-up, and 948 (0.5%) and 9776 (5.0%) experienced fatal and non-fatal CVD events, respectively, over a mean 9.7 (range 8.5-13.0) years of follow-up. Non-linear associations were found for many macronutrients. Carbohydrate intake showed a non-linear association with mortality; no association at 20-50% of total energy intake but a positive association at 50-70% of energy intake (3.14 v 2.75 per 1000 person years, average hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.28 (60-70% v 50% of energy)). A similar pattern was observed for sugar but not for starch or fibre. A higher intake of monounsaturated fat (2.94 v 3.50 per 1000 person years, average hazard ratio 0.58, 0.51 to 0.66 (20-25% v 5% of energy)) and lower intake of polyunsaturated fat (2.66 v 3.04 per 1000 person years, 0.78, 0.75 to 0.81 (5-7% v 12% of energy)) and saturated fat (2.66 v 3.59 per 1000 person years, 0.67, 0.62 to 0.73 (5-10% v 20% of energy)) were associated with a lower risk of mortality. A dietary risk matrix was developed to illustrate how dietary advice can be given based on current intake. CONCLUSION: Many associations between macronutrient intake and health outcomes are non-linear. Thus dietary advice could be tailored to current intake. Dietary guidelines on macronutrients (eg, carbohydrate) should also take account of differential associations of its components (eg, sugar and starch).",2020,Mar,BMJ,368,,m688,,10.1136/bmj.m688,32188587,#11217,Ho 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Randomized-controlled trial of a modified Mediterranean dietary program for multiple sclerosis: A pilot study.,Katz Sand I; Benn EKT; Fabian M; Fitzgerald KC; Digga E; Deshpande R; Miller A; Gallo S; Arab L,"BACKGROUND: There is a high level of interest in the potential role of diet among the MS community. There is a limited level of evidence for a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern in MS; the feasibility of conducting studies using educational tools to deliver this type of intervention and study its effects is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To establish clinical trial feasibility for future studies utilizing educational delivery of a dietary intervention in MS; to explore the effects of a modified Mediterranean dietary intervention in MS. METHODS: We randomly assigned women with MS to follow/not follow the prescribed modified Mediterranean dietary intervention for 6 months, delivered through educational sessions. The diet encouraged the intake of fish and other foods high in poly- and monounsaturated fats, fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and eliminated meat, dairy, and most processed foods and limited salt intake to <2 g/day. Primary endpoints related to meeting target enrollment within the specified time frame, adherence, and study completion. Clinical endpoints were evaluated in an exploratory fashion. RESULTS: We screened 128 potential participants and enrolled 36 within 9 months, surpassing target enrollment of 30 participants at a single center in 1 year. Self-reported adherence was excellent (90.3%), with an overall study completion rate of 94.4%. The intervention group exhibited a statistically significant decline in the trajectory of Neurological Fatigue Index-MS scores (p = 0.01), a trend toward reduced Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 scores that became significant after outlier removal (p = 0.12; p = 0.023), and a reduction in Expanded Disability Status Scale (p = 0.01) over time as compared to the non-intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: It is reasonable to expect a high level of interest and commitment to this type of dietary intervention study in MS, and feasible to deliver it purely through education in a clinical setting with high adherence levels despite restrictive requirements.

A Mediterranean dietary pattern score was calculated and categorized into 3 groups (0-3, 4-6, and 7-9 points). Additional factors included in statistical models were sex, age, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, time spent watching television, following a medical nutritional therapy, water and energy intake, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and history of hypertension or diabetes. OUTCOMES: Incidence of nephrolithiasis. Participants were classified as having incident nephrolithiasis if they reported a physician-made diagnosis of nephrolithiasis during follow-up. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 9.6 years, 735 new cases of nephrolithiasis were identified. The multivariable HRs of nephrolithiasis for the 2 highest categories of adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, using the lowest category as the reference, were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.79-1.09) and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48-0.87); P for trend=0.01. The risk for nephrolithiasis was lower with greater consumption of dairy products and vegetables and greater with higher monounsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid ratio. LIMITATIONS: No information for kidney stone composition. CONCLUSIONS: Greater adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was associated with reduced risk for incident nephrolithiasis.

Effect of Dietary Lipids on Endotoxemia Influences Postprandial Inflammatory Response.,López-Moreno J; García-Carpintero S; Jimenez-Lucena R; Haro C; Rangel-Zúñiga OA; Blanco-Rojo R; Yubero-Serrano EM; Tinahones FJ; Delgado-Lista J; Pérez-Martínez P; Roche HM; López-Miranda J; Camargo A,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) results in postprandial metabolic alterations that predisposes one to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and increased oxidative stress. We aimed to assess the effect of the consumption of the quantity and quality of dietary fat on fasting and postprandial plasma lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A subgroup of 75 subjects with metabolic syndrome was randomized to receive 1 of 4 diets: HSFA, rich in saturated fat; HMUFA, rich in monounsaturated fat; LFHCC n-3, low-fat, rich in complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; LFHCC low-fat, rich in complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with placebo, for 12 weeks each. We administered a fat challenge reflecting the fatty acid composition of the diets at postintervention. We determined the plasma lipoproteins and glucose and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and adipose tissue. LPS and LPS binding protein (LBP) plasma levels were determined by ELISA, at fasting and postprandial (4 h after a fat challenge) states. We observed a postprandial increase in LPS levels after the intake of the HSFA meal, whereas we did not find any postprandial changes after the intake of the other three diets. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between the LPS plasma levels and the gene expression of IkBa and MIF1 in PBMC. No statistically significant differences in the LBP plasma levels at fasting or postprandial states were observed. Our results suggest that the consumption of HSFA diet increases the intestinal absorption of LPS which, in turn, increases postprandial endotoxemia levels and the postprandial inflammatory response.",2017,Sep,J Agric Food Chem,65,35,7756-7763,,10.1021/acs.jafc.7b01909,28793772,#11240,López-Moreno 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary Intake of the Urban Black Population of Cape Town: The Cardiovascular Risk in Black South Africans (CRIBSA) Study.,Steyn NP; Jaffer N; Nel J; Levitt N; Steyn K; Lombard C; Peer N,"INTRODUCTION: To determine dietary intake of 19 to 64 years old urban Africans in Cape Town in 2009 and examine the changes between 1990 and 2009. METHODS: A representative cross-sectional sample (n = 544), stratified by gender and age was randomly selected in 2009 from the same areas sampled in 1990. Socio-demographic data and a 24-h dietary recall were obtained by trained field workers. The associations of dietary data with an asset index and degree of urbanization were assessed. RESULTS: Fat intakes were higher in 19-44-year-old men (32% energy (E)) and women (33.4%E) in 2009 compared with 1990 (men: 25.9%E, women: 27.0%E) while carbohydrate intakes were lower in 2009 (men 53.2%E, women: 55.5%E) than in 1990 (men: 61.3%E; women: 62%E) while sugar intake increased significantly (p < 0.01) in women. There were significant positive correlations between urbanization and total fat (p = 0.016), saturated fat (p = 0.001), monounsaturated fat (p = 0.002) and fat as a %E intake (p = 0.046). Urbanization was inversely associated with intake of carbohydrate %E (p < 0.001). Overall micronutrient intakes improved significantly compared with 1990. It should also be noted that energy and macronutrient intakes were all significant in a linear regression model using mean adequacy ratio (MAR) as a measure of dietary quality in 2009, as was duration of urbanization. DISCUSSION: The higher fat and lower carbohydrate %E intakes in this population demonstrate a transition to a more urbanized diet over last two decades. These dietary changes reflect the nutrition transitions that typically occur as a longer time is spent in urban centers.",2016,May,Nutrients,8,5,,,10.3390/nu8050285,27187459,#11242,Steyn 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary inflammatory index and anthropometric measures of obesity in a population sample at high cardiovascular risk from the PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) trial.,Ruiz-Canela M; Zazpe I; Shivappa N; Hébert JR; Sánchez-Tainta A; Corella D; Salas-Salvadó J; Fitó M; Lamuela-Raventós RM; Rekondo J; Fernández-Crehuet J; Fiol M; Santos-Lozano JM; Serra-Majem L; Pinto X; Martínez JA; Ros E; Estruch R; Martínez-González MA,"The dietary inflammatory index (DII) is a new tool to assess the inflammatory potential of the diet. In the present study, we aimed to determine the association between the DII and BMI, waist circumference and waist:height ratio (WHtR). We conducted a cross-sectional study of 7236 participants recruited into the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea trial. Information from a validated 137-item FFQ was used to calculate energy, food and nutrient intakes. A fourteen-item dietary screener was used to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet). Sex-specific multivariable linear regression models were fitted to estimate differences (and 95 % CI) in BMI, waist circumference and WHtR across the quintiles of the DII. All nutrient intakes, healthy foods and adherence to the MeDiet were higher in the quintile with the lowest DII score (more anti-inflammatory values) except for intakes of animal protein, saturated fat and monounsaturated fat. Although an inverse association between the DII and total energy was apparent, the DII was associated with higher average BMI, waist circumference and WHtR after adjusting for known risk factors. The adjusted difference in the WHtR for women and men between the highest and lowest quintiles of the DII was 1·60 % (95 % CI 0·87, 2·33) and 1·04 % (95 % CI 0·35, 1·74), respectively. Pro-inflammatory scores remained associated with obesity after controlling for the effect that adherence to a MeDiet had on inflammation. In conclusion, the present study shows a direct association between the DII and indices of obesity, and supports the hypothesis that diet may have a role in the development of obesity through inflammatory modulation mechanisms.",2015,Mar,Br J Nutr,113,6,984-95,,10.1017/S0007114514004401,25720588,#11246,Ruiz-Canela 2015,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Blood pressure differences associated with Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OMNIHEART)-like diet compared with a typical American Diet.,Molitor J; Brown IJ; Chan Q; Papathomas M; Liverani S; Molitor N; Richardson S; Van Horn L; Daviglus ML; Dyer A; Stamler J; Elliott P,"The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-Sodium (DASH-Sodium) trial demonstrated beneficial effects on blood pressure (BP) of the DASH diet with lower sodium intake when compared with typical American diet. The subsequent Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OMNIHEART) trial reported additional BP benefits from replacing carbohydrate in the DASH diet with either protein or monounsaturated fats. The primary aim of this study is to assess possible BP benefits of an OMNIHEART-like diet in free-living Americans using cross-sectional US population data of the International Study of Macronutrients, Micronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP) study. The INTERMAP data include four 24-hour dietary recalls, 2 timed 24-hour urine collections, 8 BP readings for 2195 individuals aged 40 to 59 years from 8 US INTERMAP population samples. Analyses are conducted using 2 approaches: (1) regression of BP on a linear OMNIHEART nutrient score calculated for each individual and (2) a Bayesian approach comparing estimated BP levels of an OMNIHEART-like nutrient profile with a typical American nutrient profile. After adjustment for potential confounders, an OMNIHEART score higher by 1 point was associated with systolic/diastolic BP differences of -1.0/-0.5 mm Hg (both P<0.001). Mean systolic/diastolic BPs were 111.3/68.4 and 115.2/70.6 mm Hg for Bayesian OMNIHEART and Control profiles, respectively, after controlling for possible confounders, with BP differences of -3.9/-2.2 mm Hg, P(difference≤0)=0.98/0.96. Findings were comparable for men and women, for nonhypertensive participants, and with adjustment for antihypertensive treatment.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In multivariate models, we observed no association with consumption of total fat, animal or plant fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, monounsaturated fat, or fatty fish and risk of invasive EOC.

Cardiovascular risk factors and adipocytokines levels after two hypocaloric diets with different fat distribution in obese subjects and rs6923761 gene variant of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor.,de Luis DA; Aller R; Izaola O; Bachiller R; Pacheco D,"BACKGROUND: The role of GLP-1 R variants on body weight response after dietary intervention is unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the effect of this polymorphism on cardiovascular risk factors, adipokine levels and weight loss secondary to a high monounsaturated fat vs. a high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diets in obese subjects. DESIGN: 391 obese subjects were randomly allocated to one of these two diets for a period of 3 months; diet M (high monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet) and diet P (high polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fat hypocaloric diet). RESULTS: Two hundred and twelve patients (54.2 %) had the genotype GG (wild group) and 179 (45.8 %) patients had the next genotypes; GA (146 patients, 37.3 %) or AA (33 patients, 8.7 %) (Mutant group). With both diets and in wild-type and mutant-type groups, BMI, weight, fat mass, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure decreased. Anthropometric parameters were higher in non-A-allele carriers than A-allele carriers. With both diets and in both genotypes, leptin, insulin levels and HOMA decreased. With the diet P and in wild genotype, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels decreased, too. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a lack of association of rs6923761 GLP-1 R polymorphism with weight loss after a high monounsaturated fat and a high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diets. Better anthropometric parameters in obese subjects with the mutant allele (A) of rs6923761 GLP-1 R polymorphism were observed.

Serum hyperglycemia might be not related to fat composition of diet and vegetable composition of diet might improve sugar control in taiwanese diabetic subjects.,Hou YC; Chang YL; Kuo SC; Chiang CF; Chiang CY; Lin YF; Weng PC; Hu FC; Wu JH; Lai CH,"OBJECTIVE: This is an Asian study, which was designed to examine the correlations between biochemical data and food composition of diabetic patients in Taiwan. METHODS: One hundred and seventy Taiwanese diabetic patients were enrolled. The correlations between biochemical data and diet composition (from 24-hour recall of intake food) of these patients were explored (Spearman correlation, p < 0.05). Diet components were also correlated with each other to show diet characteristics of diabetic patients in Taiwan. Linear regression was also performed for the significantly correlated groups to estimate possible impacts from diet composition to biochemical data. RESULTS: Postprandial serum glucose level was negatively correlated with fat percentage of diet, intake amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid and fiber diet composition. Hemoglobin A1c was negatively correlated with fat diet, polyunsaturated fatty acid and vegetable diet. Fat composition, calorie percentage accounted by polyunsaturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid in diet seemed to be negatively correlated with sugar percentage of diet and positively correlated with vegetable and fiber composition of diet. Linear regression showed that intake amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid, calorie percentage accounted by polyunsaturated fatty acid, fat percentage of diet, vegetable composition of diet would predict lower hemoglobin A1c and postprandial blood sugar. Besides, higher percentage of fat diet composition could predict higher percentage of vegetable diet composition in Taiwanese diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: Fat diet might not elevate serum glucose. Vegetable diet and polyunsaturated fatty acid diet composition might be correlated with better sugar control in Taiwanese diabetic patients.",2014,,Int J Med Sci,11,5,515-21,,10.7150/ijms.8158,24688317,#11256,Hou 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase protein expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue is decreased after an isoenergetic low-fat high-complex carbohydrate diet in the metabolic syndrome.,van Hees AM; Jocken JW; Essers Y; Roche HM; Saris WH; Blaak EE,"The objective was to determine the contribution of dietary fat quantity and composition to lipolysis and lipolytic gene expression in humans in relation to obesity, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Men and women with the MetS were randomly assigned to one of four isoenergetic diets: a high-fat saturated fat diet (n=10), a high-fat monounsaturated fat diet (n=7), and two low-fat high-complex carbohydrate (LFHCC) diets, one supplemented with 1.24 g/day long-chain n-3 PUFA (LFHCC: n=7, LFHCCn-3: n=8). Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were taken before and after the 12-week dietary intervention period. ATGL and HSL mRNA and protein expression was determined. Whole body rate of appearance of free fatty acids (Ra(FFA)) was determined by intravenous infusion of [(2)H(2)]-palmitate in a subgroup of men (n=20). Adipose tissue ATGL and HSL mRNA and protein expression was not affected by alterations in dietary fat composition. Pooled analysis comparing the low- and high-fat diets showed that ATGL and HSL protein expression was significantly reduced after the LFHCC diets (P=.04), irrespective of long-chain n-3 PUFA. Moreover, LFHCC diets lowered fasting insulin, HOMA(IR), and (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations (P≤.05). Changes in ATGL and HSL protein expression was positively associated with changes in whole body Ra(FFA) (P<.03). The low-fat high-complex carbohydrate diets reduced ATGL and HSL protein expression and significantly improved circulating lipids and insulin sensitivity.

Complement component 3 (C3) is a novel cardiometabolic risk factor. Whether dietary fat intake modulates MetS risk conferred by elevated C3 concentrations is unknown. Our objective is to investigate the relationship between C3 concentrations and risk of the MetS and its phenotypes, and to further examine whether dietary fat intake modulates these relationships. METHODS: Biochemical, dietary and lifestyle measurements were determined in the LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX study of MetS cases and matched controls (n=1754). RESULTS: Elevated C3 concentrations (>median) were associated with increased risk of impaired insulin sensitivity [OR 1.78, CI 1.34-2.36, P<0.0001], insulin resistance [OR 1.73, CI 1.31-2.89, P=0.0001], abdominal obesity [OR 2.15, CI 1.43-3.24, P=0.0002] and low HDL cholesterol [OR 1.40, CI 1.05-1.86, P=0.02] compared to low C3 concentrations. Increased MetS risk conferred by elevated C3 concentrations [OR 3.11, 95% CI 2.52-3.82, P<0.0001] was further accentuated among high dietary fat consumers [OR 4.80, 95% CI 2.77-8.33, P<0.0001] (particularly of saturated [OR 4.05, 95% CI 2.33-7.05, P<0.0001] and monounsaturated fat [OR 4.48, 95% CI 2.62-7.56, P<0.0001]), and smokers [OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.12-6.94, P<0.0001], however this effect was abolished in abdominally lean individuals [OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.69-3.14, P=0.33].

Dietary intake of cholesterol is positively associated and use of cholesterol-lowering medication is negatively associated with prevalent age-related hearing loss.,Gopinath B; Flood VM; Teber E; McMahon CM; Mitchell P,"We aimed to assess associations between dietary intake of fats (saturated and monounsaturated fats and cholesterol) and certain food groups (butter, margarine, and nuts) with the prevalence, incidence, and progression of age-related hearing loss. We also aimed to investigate the link between serum lipids and cholesterol-lowering medication (statins) and hearing loss. The Blue Mountains Hearing Study is a population-based survey of age-related hearing loss. Hearing loss was measured in 2956 participants (aged ≥50 y) and was defined as the pure-tone average (PTA) of frequencies 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz > 25 dB hearing level (PTA(0.5-4 kHz)).

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the effects of altering the glycemic index or the amount of carbohydrate on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose, lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in T2DM patients. DESIGN: Subjects with T2DM managed by diet alone (n=162) were randomly assigned to receive high-carbohydrate, high-glycemic-index (high-GI), high-carbohydrate, low-glycemic-index (low-GI), or low-carbohydrate, high-monounsaturated-fat (low-CHO) diets for 1 y. RESULTS: The high-GI, low-GI, and low-CHO diets contained, respectively, 47%, 52%, and 39% of energy as carbohydrate and 31%, 27%, and 40% of energy as fat; they had GIs of 63, 55, and 59, respectively. Body weight and HbA1c did not differ significantly between diets. Fasting glucose was higher (P=0.041), but 2-h postload glucose was lower (P=0.010) after 12 mo of the low-GI diet. With the low-GI diet, overall mean triacylglycerol was 12% higher and HDL cholesterol 4% lower than with the low-CHO diet (P<0.05), but the difference in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol disappeared by 6 mo (time x diet interaction, P=0.044). Overall mean CRP with the low-GI diet, 1.95 mg/L, was 30% less than that with the high-GI diet, 2.75 mg/L (P=0.0078); the concentration with the low-CHO diet, 2.35 mg/L, was intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with T2DM managed by diet alone with optimal glycemic control, long-term HbA1c was not affected by altering the GI or the amount of dietary carbohydrate.

However, to our knowledge, no prospective US study has investigated the Mediterranean dietary pattern in relation to mortality. METHODS: Study participants included 214,284 men and 166,012 women in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study. During follow-up for all-cause mortality (1995-2005), 27,799 deaths were documented. In the first 5 years of follow-up, 5,985 cancer deaths and 3,451 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths were reported. We used a 9-point score to assess conformity with the Mediterranean dietary pattern (components included vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains, fish, monounsaturated fat-saturated fat ratio, alcohol, and meat). We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using age- and multivariate-adjusted Cox models. RESULTS: The Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In men, the multivariate HRs comparing high to low conformity for all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.83), 0.78 (95% CI, 0.69-0.87), and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91), respectively.

We have assessed the relations between dietary components, including the different types of fatty acids (saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated) and serum lipids and apolipoproteins in a group of 673 6-year-old children of the town of Rivas-Vaciamadrid, Spain. Children in the highest tertile of total fat consumption, when compared with children in the lowest tertile, had higher mean levels of total cholesterol (188.3 mg/dl vs. 146.8 mg/dl), triglycerides (56.7 mg/dl vs. 51.3 mg/dl), LDL cholesterol (120.7 mg/dl vs. 92.6 mg/dl), HDL cholesterol (56.2 mg/dl vs. 54.5 mg/dl) and apolipoprotein B (86.8 mg/dl vs. 62.9 mg/dl). When compared with children in the lowest tertile, children in the highest tertile of saturated fat consumption had significantly higher mean levels of total cholesterol (206.3 mg/dl vs. 151.8 mg/dl), LDL cholesterol (140.6 mg/dl vs. 95.1 mg/dl) and apolipoprotein B (99.2 mg/dl vs. 64.3 mg/dl) and lower mean levels of HDL cholesterol (53.5 mg/dl vs. 57.5 mg/dl), whereas children in the highest tertile of monounsaturated fat consumption had significantly higher mean levels of HDL cholesterol (56.5 mg/dl vs. 51.8 mg/dl) and lower levels of total cholesterol (133.2 mg/dl vs. 201.6 mg/dl), LDL cholesterol (93.1 mg/dl vs. 137.5 mg/dl) and apolipoprotein B (68.6 mg/dl vs. 94.9 mg/dl) than children in the lowest tertile.

Effect of a mediterranean-style diet on endothelial dysfunction and markers of vascular inflammation in the metabolic syndrome: a randomized trial.,Esposito K; Marfella R; Ciotola M; Di Palo C; Giugliano F; Giugliano G; D'Armiento M; D'Andrea F; Giugliano D,"CONTEXT: The metabolic syndrome has been identified as a target for dietary therapies to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease; however, the role of diet in the etiology of the metabolic syndrome is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on endothelial function and vascular inflammatory markers in patients with the metabolic syndrome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, single-blind trial conducted from June 2001 to January 2004 at a university hospital in Italy among 180 patients (99 men and 81 women) with the metabolic syndrome, as defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the intervention group (n = 90) were instructed to follow a Mediterranean-style diet and received detailed advice about how to increase daily consumption of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and olive oil; patients in the control group (n = 90) followed a prudent diet (carbohydrates, 50%-60%; proteins, 15%-20%; total fat, <30%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nutrient intake; endothelial function score as a measure of blood pressure and platelet aggregation response to l-arginine; lipid and glucose parameters; insulin sensitivity; and circulating levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukins 6 (IL-6), 7 (IL-7), and 18 (IL-18). RESULTS: After 2 years, patients following the Mediterranean-style diet consumed more foods rich in monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and fiber and had a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. Total fruit, vegetable, and nuts intake (274 g/d), whole grain intake (103 g/d), and olive oil consumption (8 g/d) were also significantly higher in the intervention group (P<.001). The level of physical activity increased in both groups by approximately 60%, without difference between groups (P =.22). Mean (SD) body weight decreased more in patients in the intervention group (-4.0 [1.1] kg) than in those in the control group (-1.2 [0.6] kg) (P<.001). Compared with patients consuming the control diet, patients consuming the intervention diet had significantly reduced serum concentrations of hs-CRP (P =.01), IL-6 (P =.04), IL-7 (P = 0.4), and IL-18 (P = 0.3), as well as decreased insulin resistance (P<.001). Endothelial function score improved in the intervention group (mean [SD] change, +1.9 [0.6]; P<.001) but remained stable in the control group (+0.2 [0.2]; P =.33). At 2 years of follow-up, 40 patients in the intervention group still had features of the metabolic syndrome, compared with 78 patients in the control group (P<.001).

Dietary fat intake and 6-year cognitive change in an older biracial community population.,Morris MC; Evans DA; Bienias JL; Tangney CC; Wilson RS,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether consumption of different types of fat is associated with age-related change in cognition. METHODS: The authors related fat consumption to 6-year change in cognitive function among 2,560 participants of the Chicago Health and Aging Project, ages 65 and older, with no history of heart attack, stroke, or diabetes at baseline. Fat intake was measured by food frequency questionnaire. Cognitive function was measured at baseline and 3-year and 6-year follow-ups, using the average z score of four cognitive tests: the East Boston Tests of Immediate and Delayed Recall, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test. RESULTS: In separate mixed models adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors and intakes of antioxidant nutrients and other dietary fats, higher intakes of saturated fat (p for trend = 0.04) and trans-unsaturated fat (p for trend = 0.07) were linearly associated with greater decline in cognitive score over 6 years. These associations became stronger in analyses that eliminated persons whose fat intake changed in recent years or whose baseline cognitive scores were in the lowest 15%. Inverse associations with cognitive decline were observed in these latter restricted analyses for high intake of monounsaturated fat and a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat intake. Intakes of total fat, vegetable and animal fats, and cholesterol were not associated with cognitive change. CONCLUSION: A diet high in saturated or trans-unsaturated fat or low in nonhydrogenated unsaturated fats may be associated with cognitive decline among older persons.",2004,May,Neurology,62,9,1573-9,,10.1212/01.wnl.0000123250.82849.b6,15136684,#11308,Morris 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Adolescent diet and incidence of proliferative benign breast disease.,Baer HJ; Schnitt SJ; Connolly JL; Byrne C; Cho E; Willett WC; Colditz GA,"Studies of adult diet and risk of breast cancer have yielded mainly null results, but this does not rule out a possible impact of adolescent diet. This study examined associations between components of adolescent diet and risk of proliferative benign breast disease (BBD), a marker for breast cancer. The study population consisted of 29494 women in the Nurses' Health Study II who completed a questionnaire on adolescent diet in 1998 and who were 33-53 years of age at that time. A total of 470 new cases of proliferative BBD were identified between 1991 and 1997. Incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for quartiles of energy-adjusted intakes, using the lowest quartile of each as the reference group. Total fat intake during adolescence was unrelated to risk of proliferative BBD, although there were positive associations for intakes of animal fat and monounsaturated fat and an inverse association for intake of vegetable fat. For vitamin E intake, the multivariate RRs were 1.13, 0.88, and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61-1.04) for women in the second, third, and highest quartiles, respectively (P for trend = 0.05). The multivariate RRs were 0.94, 0.99, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.57-0.98) for women in increasing quartiles of fiber intake (P for trend = 0.05). Vegetable fat, vitamin E, and fiber intakes during adolescence were inversely associated with risk of proliferative BBD in this population. Confirmation of these associations may suggest a means for prevention of breast cancer.",2003,Nov,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,12,11 Pt 1,1159-67,,,14652275,#11313,Baer 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fats and asthma in teenagers: analyses of the first Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT).,Huang SL; Pan WH,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence of asthma may be associated with dietary factors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between nutrient intake and physician-diagnosed asthma and allergic rhinitis. METHODS: A stratified, multiple-staged sampling design was used to select study areas, in which household interviews were carried out to gather information on health status and 24-h food recall. Data from 1166 adolescents, 13-17 years of age, were analysed. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, total calorie and energy-adjusted fat intake were associated with the prevalence of asthma, whereas vitamin A and vitamin C intake showed negative association with asthma. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for sex and levels of urbanization; intake of saturated fats was associated with increased risk (OR = 2.02 for an increase of one SD, 95%CI 1.40-2.90), while monounsaturated fats were inversely related to asthma (OR = 0.65 for an increase of one SD, 95%CI 0.43-0.99). Vitamin C intake in the lowest quartile was associated with elevated risk for asthma with marginal significance (OR = 1.81, 95%CI 0.88-3.71, P = 0.10). None of the nutritional factors was associated with allergic rhinitis.

Dietary and lifestyle factors in relation to plasma leptin concentrations among normal weight and overweight men.,Chu NF; Stampfer MJ; Spiegelman D; Rifai N; Hotamisligil GS; Rimm EB,"OBJECTIVE: Leptin, the product of the obesity (ob) gene, is a multi-functional polypeptide that is important in energy metabolism, which is strongly correlated with body fat mass and body mass index (BMI). In a recent prospective study, we found that leptin was positively associated with 4 y weight gain among overweight and obese men. This suggests that leptin resistance, marked by hyperleptinemia among obese subjects, may be an important marker for weight gain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether modifiable dietary and lifestyle factors are associated with plasma leptin concentrations among US men. METHODS: We included 268 men aged 47--83 y (who were free of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer, except nonmelanoma skin cancer) from the ongoing Health Professionals Follow-up Study. These subjects completed a detailed dietary and lifestyle questionnaire (including cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and physical activity) and provided a fasting venous blood sample in 1994. All blood samples were stored in a deep freeze (-70 degrees C) for 4--5 y before being analyzed. Plasma leptin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Men in the highest quintile of plasma leptin (mean=14.4 ng/ml) weighed more, were less physically active, and had higher total and saturated fat and cholesterol intake than men in the lowest quintile (mean=3.0 ng/ml). Physical activity and current smoking were inversely associated with plasma leptin concentrations (P<0.001). A 20 MET difference in physical activity per week (equivalent to approximately 3 h of jogging) was associated with 0.38--0.58 ng/ml lower plasma leptin concentrations for normal weight and overweight men after adjusting for total energy and fat intake, BMI and other confounding variables. Total fat and monounsaturated fat intakes were positively associated with plasma leptin concentrations even after adjusting for BMI and other confounding variables; however, this association was limited to men of normal weight (BMI<25 kg/m(2)). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that physical activity may be a significant determinant of plasma leptin concentrations in men. Increasing physical activity is associated with lower plasma leptin concentrations even after adjusting for BMI. Physical activity may lower leptin concentrations not only due to decreased body fat mass, but potentially through an increase in leptin sensitivity.

Association of dietary intake of fat and fatty acids with risk of breast cancer.,Holmes MD; Hunter DJ; Colditz GA; Stampfer MJ; Hankinson SE; Speizer FE; Rosner B; Willett WC,"CONTEXT: High intakes of fat and specific fatty acids, including total, animal, saturated, polyunsaturated, and trans-unsaturated fats, have been postulated to increase breast cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intakes of fat and fatty acids are associated with breast cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study (Nurses' Health Study) conducted in the United States beginning in 1976. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 88795 women free of cancer in 1980 and followed up for 14 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relative risk (RR) of invasive breast cancer for an incremental increase of fat intake, ascertained by food frequency questionnaire in 1980, 1984, 1986, and 1990. RESULTS: A total of 2956 women were diagnosed as having breast cancer. Compared with women obtaining 30.1% to 35% of energy from fat, women consuming 20% or less had a multivariate RR of breast cancer of 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.80). In multivariate models, the RR (95% CI) for a 5%-of-energy increase was 0.97 (0.94-1.00) for total fat, 0.98 (0.96-1.01) for animal fat, 0.97 (0.93-1.02) for vegetable fat, 0.94 (0.88-1.01) for saturated fat, 0.91 (0.79-1.04) for polyunsaturated fat, and 0.94 (0.88-1.00) for monounsaturated fat. For a 1% increase in energy from trans-unsaturated fat, the values were 0.92 (0.86-0.98), and for a 0.1% increase in energy from omega-3 fat from fish, the values were 1.09 (1.03-1.16). In a model including fat, protein, and energy, the RR for a 5% increase in total fat, which can be interpreted as the risk of substituting this amount of fat for an equal amount of energy from carbohydrate, was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). In similar models, no significant association of risk was evident with any major types of fat. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that lower intake of total fat or specific major types of fat was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.",1999,Mar,JAMA,281,10,914-20,,10.1001/jama.281.10.914,10078488,#11337,Holmes 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
A prospective study of association of monounsaturated fat and other types of fat with risk of breast cancer.,Wolk A; Bergström R; Hunter D; Willett W; Ljung H; Holmberg L; Bergkvist L; Bruce A; Adami HO,"BACKGROUND: Animal studies suggest that monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat may have opposite effects on the risk of breast cancer. METHODS: We performed a population-based prospective cohort study, including 61,471 women aged 40 to 76 years from 2 counties in central Sweden who did not have any previous diagnosis of cancer; 674 cases of invasive breast cancer occurred during an average follow-up of 4.2 years. All subjects answered a validated 67-item food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models were used to obtain adjusted rate ratio (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: After mutual adjustment of different types of fat, an inverse association with monounsaturated fat and a positive association with polyunsaturated fat were found. The RR for each 10-g increment in daily intake of monounsaturated fat was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.22-0.95), whereas the RR for a 5-g increment of polyunsaturated fat was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.02-2.78); the increments correspond to approximately 2 SDs of intake in the population. Comparing the highest quartile of intake with the lowest, we found an RR of 0.8 (95% CI, 0.5-1.2) for monounsaturated fat and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9-1.6) for polyunsaturated fat. Saturated fat was not associated with the risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that various types of fat may have specific opposite effects on the risk of breast cancer that closely resemble the corresponding effects in experimental animals. Research investigations and health policy considerations should take into account the emerging evidence that monounsaturated fat might be protective for risk of breast cancer.",1998,Jan,Arch Intern Med,158,1,41-5,,10.1001/archinte.158.1.41,9437377,#11341,Wolk 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Inverse association of dietary fat with development of ischemic stroke in men.,Gillman MW; Cupples LA; Millen BE; Ellison RC; Wolf PA,"CONTEXT: A few ecological and cohort studies in Asian populations suggest an inverse association of the intake of both fat and saturated fat with risk of stroke. However, data among western populations are scant. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of stroke incidence with intake of fat and type of fat among middle-aged US men during 20 years of follow-up. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Framingham Heart Study, a population-based cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 832 men, aged 45 through 65 years, who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline (1966-1969). MEASUREMENTS AND DATA ANALYSIS: The diet of each subject was assessed at baseline by a single 24-hour dietary recall, from which intakes of energy and macronutrients were estimated. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, we calculated age-adjusted cumulative incidence rates of stroke. Using Cox regression, we estimated stroke incidence relative risks during 20 years of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of ischemic stroke, which occurred in 61 subjects during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Mean intakes were 10975 kJ for energy; 114 g (39% of energy) for total fat; 44 g (15%) for saturated fat; 46 g (16%) for monounsaturated fat; and 16 g (5%) for polyunsaturated fat. Risk of ischemic stroke declined across the increasing quintile of total fat (log-rank trend P=.008), saturated fat (P=.002), and monounsaturated fat (P=.008) but not polyunsaturated fat (P=.33). The age- and energy-adjusted relative risk for each increment of 3% of energy from total fat was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-0.94); for an increment of 1% from saturated fat, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.98); and for 1% from monounsaturated fat, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96). Adjustment for cigarette smoking, glucose intolerance, body mass index, blood pressure, blood cholesterol level, physical activity, and intake of vegetables and fruits and alcohol did not materially change the results. Too few cases of hemorrhagic stroke (n=14) occurred to draw inferences. CONCLUSION: Intakes of fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat were associated with reduced risk of ischemic stroke in men.",1997,Dec,JAMA,278,24,2145-50,,,9417007,#11343,Gillman 1997,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Nutrient intake and blood pressure in the Dietary Intervention Study in Children.,Simons-Morton DG; Hunsberger SA; Van Horn L; Barton BA; Robson AM; McMahon RP; Muhonen LE; Kwiterovich PO; Lasser NL; Kimm SY; Greenlick MR,"Delineating the role that diet plays in blood pressure levels in children is important for guiding dietary recommendations for the prevention of hypertension. The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between dietary nutrients and blood pressure in children. Data were analyzed from 662 participants in the Dietary Intervention Study in Children who had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and were aged 8 to 11 years at baseline. Three 24-hour dietary recalls, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, height, and weight were obtained at baseline, 1 year, and 3 years. Nutrients analyzed were the micronutrients calcium, magnesium, and potassium; the macronutrients protein, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and monounsaturated fat; dietary cholesterol; and total dietary fiber. Baseline and 3-year longitudinal relationships were examined through multivariate models on diastolic and systolic pressures separately, controlling for height, weight, sex, and total caloric intake. The following associations were found in longitudinal analyses: analyzing each nutrient separately, for systolic pressure, inverse associations with calcium (P < .05); magnesium, potassium, and protein (all P < .01); and fiber (P < .05), and direct associations with total fat and monounsaturated fat (both P < .05); for diastolic pressure, inverse associations with calcium (P < .01); magnesium and potassium (both P < .05), protein (P < .01); and carbohydrates and fiber (both P < .05), and direct associations with polyunsaturated fat (P < .01) and monounsaturated fat (P < .05).

The association of dietary fat and fiber with coagulation factor VII in the elderly: the Rotterdam Study.,Mennen LI; Witteman JC; den Breeijen JH; Schouten EG; de Jong PT; Hofman A; Grobbee DE,"Considerable evidence suggests that a high concentration of coagulation factor VII is a risk factor for ischemic heart disease. Factor VII is known to be influenced by dietary fat and probably by dietary fiber in young and middle-aged people. There are no data available in elderly people and the effects of different types of fat are unclear. This study examines the relation of factor VII activity (factor VIIc) with dietary fat and fiber in The Rotterdam Study. The Rotterdam Study is a population-based study among 7983 men and women aged > or = 55 y. Factor VIIc was measured in 3007 subjects (1730 women and 1277 men aged 67.3 +/- 7.8 and 66.3 +/- 7.0 y, respectively). Measurements included cardiovascular risk factors and habitual diet was assessed by a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Associations that were significant or nearly significant differed for some nutrients between men and women. Total fat intake showed a direct association with factor VIIc only in women (beta = 0.1%/g; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.20). Saturated fat intake was associated with factor VIIc in women (beta = 0.18%/g; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.36) and in men (beta = 0.11%/g; 95% CI: -0.06, 0.27). Monounsaturated fat was positively related to factor VIIc in women (beta = 0.17%/g; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.39) and polyunsaturated fat was inversely associated with factor VIIc in men (beta = -0.15%/g; 95% CI: -0.33, 0.03). Fiber intake was inversely associated with factor VIIc in both men (beta = -0.31%/g; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.06) and women (beta = -0.36%/g; 95% CI: -0.63, -0.09). No associations were found for energy intake. In elderly persons, factor VIIc is associated with fat and fiber intake.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with a 7-year follow-up period. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Sample of 35 156 Iowa women aged 55 to 69 years with no prior history of cancer who returned the 1986 baseline questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (104 incident cases). MAIN RESULTS: After controlling for age, marital status, residence, total energy intake, and transfusion history, the relative risks (RRs) for the highest tertile of intake compared with the lowest were 2.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.30; P for trend = .01) for animal fat, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.07-2.67; P for trend = .02) for saturated fat, and 1.90 (95% CI, 1.18-3.04; P for trend = .01) for monounsaturated fat, and there was no association with vegetable fat or polyunsaturated fat. Greater intake of animal protein (RR = 1.52; 95% CI, 0.94-2.44; P for trend = .08), but not vegetable protein, was associated with elevated risk, and this was mainly explained by greater consumption of red meat (RR = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.13-3.47; P for trend = .02) and hamburger in particular (RR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.23-4.48; P for trend = .02).

"Dietary factors and risk of prostate cancer: a case-control study in Ontario, Canada.",Rohan TE; Howe GR; Burch JD; Jain M,"The relationship between risk of prostate cancer and dietary intake of energy, fat, vitamin A, and other nutrients was investigated in a case-control study conducted in Ontario, Canada. Cases were men with a recent, histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate notified to the Ontario Cancer Registry between April 1990 and April 1992. Controls were selected randomly from assessment lists maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Revenue, and were frequency-matched to the cases on age. The study included 207 cases (51.4 percent of those eligible) and 207 controls (39.4 percent of those eligible), and information on dietary intake was collected from them by means of a quantitative diet history. There was a positive association between energy intake and risk of prostate cancer, such that men at the uppermost quartile level of energy intake had a 75 percent increase in risk. In contrast, there was no clear association between the non-energy effects of total fat and monounsaturated fat intake and prostate cancer risk. There was some evidence for an inverse association with saturated fat intake, although the dose-response pattern was irregular. There was a weak (statistically nonsignificant) positive association between polyunsaturated fat intake and risk of prostate cancer. Relatively high levels of retinol intake were associated with reduced risk, but there was essentially no association between dietary beta-carotene intake and risk. There was no alteration in risk in association with dietary fiber, cholesterol, and vitamins C and E. Although these patterns were evident both overall and within age-strata, and persisted after adjustment for a number of potential confounding factors, they could reflect (in particular) the effect of nonrespondent bias.",1995,Mar,Cancer Causes Control,6,2,145-54,,10.1007/BF00052775,7749054,#11358,Rohan 1995,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary intake and colon cancer: sex- and anatomic site-specific associations.,West DW; Slattery ML; Robison LM; Schuman KL; Ford MH; Mahoney AW; Lyon JL; Sorensen AW,"A case-control study was conducted in Utah between July 1979 and June 1983 in which 231 cases of colon cancer identified through the Utah Cancer Registry and 391 controls identified through random digit dialing were interviewed. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated comparing the highest exposure categories with the lowest exposure categories. The highest quintile of body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2 for males; weight (kg)/height (m)1.5 for females) was associated with increased risk in both males (OR = 2.1) and females (OR = 2.3). In females, total dietary fat (OR = 1.9) and energy intake (OR = 1.5) were associated with an increased colon cancer risk after adjusting for age, body mass index, and crude fiber. Fiber was protective in females (OR = 0.5) after adjusting for age, body mass index, and energy intake, as was beta-carotene (OR = 0.5) after also adjusting for crude fiber. Adjusted risk estimates in males were 2.0 for total dietary fat, 3.8 for polyunsaturated fat, 2.1 for monounsaturated fat, 2.1 for energy intake, 2.5 for protein, 0.3 for fiber, 0.4 for beta-carotene, and 0.3 for cruciferous vegetables. Risk estimates differed by site of cancer within the colon. In males, protein (OR = 3.8) was a risk factor for cancer of the descending colon, while fats (OR = 2.7-8.8) increased the risk of cancer of the ascending colon.

Dietary fat and breast cancer in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.,Jones DY; Schatzkin A; Green SB; Block G; Brinton LA; Ziegler RG; Hoover R; Taylor PR,"The relationship between dietary fat intake and breast cancer incidence was examined in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study cohort. This cohort is derived from adults (greater than or equal to 25 yr) examined in the NHANES I (1970-75) cross-sectional survey of the U.S. population and provides a mean follow-up time of 10 years. An analytic sample of 5,485 women, including 99 breast cancer cases (34 premenopausal and 65 postmenopausal at NHANES I baseline), was examined for associations with dietary intake of fat, percent energy from fat, total energy, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and cholesterol on the basis of a 24-hour recall administered at the baseline NHANES I examination. No significant differences in dietary fat intake between cases and noncases were evident when mean intakes for each group were compared. For total fat (g) and saturated fat (g), a significant inverse association was indicated in proportional hazards analyses. Adjustment of fat for total energy intake resulted in a smaller effect that was no longer statistically significant. Adjustment for accepted breast cancer risk factors did not change these findings. This prospective study of a sample from the U.S. population does not support the hypothesis that high dietary fat intake increases breast cancer risk. Indeed, some lower risk associated with high fat intake may be indicated, although this result may be influenced by methodologic problems with the dietary assessment.",1987,Sep,J Natl Cancer Inst,79,3,465-71,,,3476789,#11375,Jones 1987,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The Portfolio Diet and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Findings From the Women's Health Initiative Prospective Cohort Study.,Glenn AJ; Li J; Lo K; Jenkins DJA; Boucher BA; Hanley AJ; Kendall CWC; Shadyab AH; Tinker LF; Chessler SD; Howard BV; Liu S; Sievenpiper JL,"OBJECTIVE: A plant-based dietary pattern, the Portfolio Diet, has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, no study has evaluated the association of this diet with incident type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis included 145,299 postmenopausal women free of diabetes at baseline in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trials and Observational Study from 1993 to 2021. Adherence to the diet was assessed with a score based on six components (high in plant protein [soy and pulses], nuts, viscous fiber, plant sterols, and monounsaturated fat and low in saturated fat and cholesterol) determined from a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of the association of the Portfolio Diet, alongside the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets, with incident type 2 diabetes, with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 16.0 years, 13,943 cases of incident type 2 diabetes were identified. In comparisons of the highest with the lowest quintiles of adherence, the HRs for risk of incident type 2 diabetes were 0.77 (95% CI 0.72, 0.82) for the Portfolio Diet, 0.69 (0.64, 0.73) for the DASH diet, and 0.78 (0.74, 0.83) for the Mediterranean diet. These findings were attenuated by 10% after additional adjustment for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Greater adherence to the plant-predominant Portfolio, DASH, and Mediterranean diets was prospectively associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women.",2023,Jan,Diabetes Care,46,1,28-37,,10.2337/dc22-1029,36162007,#11378,Glenn 2023,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Association Between Dietary Intake and Serum Uric Acid Levels in Kidney Transplant Patients.,Limirio LS; Santos HO; Dos Reis AS; de Oliveira EP,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between dietary intake and uric acid (UA) levels in kidney transplant patients (KTPs). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed with 113 KTPs. Dietary intake assessment was carried out thorough two 24-hour dietary recalls using the 5-step multiple pass method. We evaluated the intake of energy, carbohydrate, total protein, animal protein, vegetable protein, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, cholesterol, total sugar, added sugars, total fiber, insoluble fiber, soluble fiber, alcohol, caffeine, fructose, glucose, lactose, sucrose, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and calcium. The intake of several food groups (portions) was also evaluated. Hyperuricemia was classified as >7.0 and >6 mg/dL for men and women, respectively. RESULTS: In odds ratio analyses, the individuals who ingested more vegetable protein (g/kg) and caffeine (mg) presented lower chance to have hyperuricemia. In linear regression, animal protein (g) intake was positively associated (β = 0.011, P = .048), while vegetable protein (g/kg) intake was inversely associated (β = -2.45, P = .047) with serum UA. However, after a multiple linear regression including vegetable and animal protein intakes together, only vegetable protein intake remained associated with UA. The intake of other nutrients and portions of food groups was not associated with UA. All the analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hypertension, body mass index, glomerular filtration rate, use of medicines, and caloric intake misreporting. CONCLUSIONS: Vegetable protein and caffeine intakes were inversely associated with UA in KTPs.",2021,Nov,J Ren Nutr,31,6,637-647,,10.1053/j.jrn.2020.11.009,33931313,#11383,Limirio 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Trends in the Intake of Fatty Acids and Their Food Source According to Obese Status Among Korean Adult Population Using KNHANES 2007-2017.,Ahn J; Kim NS; Lee BK; Park Kim S,"BACKGROUND: Increasing obesity rates are related to energy intake with carbohydrate and fat ratio. Using Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2017 data, we examined the hypothesis that the fat intake and food sources of dietary fats had changed over the last 10 years according to gender and obesity status in adult population ≥19 years. METHODS: The food intake of each participant was collected by the 24-hour recall method, and nutrient intake including different fatty acids was calculated. The fatty acid intakes from 7 food groups were determined according to gender and obesity status. RESULTS: Body mass index increased in both genders of the obese group over the decade, but it decreased in the normal-weight group. In men, energy intake was higher in the obese group than in the lean group, but the opposite trend was shown in women. Total fat intake including various fatty acids continuously and sharply increased in both men and women until 2016, then slightly declined only in men. The source of saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake was mainly from the animal food group in men and women regardless of obese status, and SFA and monounsaturated fatty acid from the animal food group gradually increased over time in both genders. N-3 fatty acid intake markedly decreased from fish and crabs and increased from sauces and nuts regardless of genders and the obese status from 2008 to 2017. Polyunsaturated fatty acid and N-6 fatty acid intake increased from bread, cookies, sauces, and nuts regardless of genders and obesity status. CONCLUSION: Fat intake was higher in obese men, but this was opposite in women. The N-3 fatty acid intake from seafood should increase, and the fat composition in sauce needs to be modulated to increase N-3 fatty acids.",2020,Mar,Food Nutr Bull,41,1,77-88,,10.1177/0379572119898323,31960712,#11395,Ahn 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Single nucleotide polymorphisms at the ADIPOQ gene locus rs1501299 interact with different type of dietary fatty acids in two hypocaloric diets.,de Luis DA; Izaola O; Primo D; Aller R,"OBJECTIVE: Some adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been related to adiponectin levels and metabolic parameters. Few studies of interaction gene-nutrient have been realized in this topic area. The aim of our study was to analyze the effect of the rs1501299 ADIPOQ gene polymorphism, and the dietary intake on total adiponectin levels and the insulin resistance changes after an enriched-monounsaturated fat (Diet M) vs. an enriched-polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet (Diet P). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Caucasian population of 363 obese patients was enrolled in a randomized clinical trial with two hypocaloric diets. Before and after 12 weeks on each hypocaloric diet, an anthropometric evaluation, an assessment of nutritional intake and a biochemical analysis were realized. The statistical analysis was performed for the combined GT and TT as a group (mutant) and GG as second group (wild). RESULTS: With both caloric restriction strategies, body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and leptin levels decreased. After Diet P, only subjects with GG genotype showed a significant improvement in the insulin levels (GG vs. GT±TT) (-3.2±1.0 mU/L vs. -0.6±0.4 mU/L: p=0.01) and in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) (-1.1±0.2 units vs. -0.3±0.4 units: p=0.02). The same improvement in both parameters was reported after Diet M: insulin levels (-3.7±0.9 mU/L vs. -0.4±0.5 mU/L: p=0.01) and HOMA-IR (-1.0±0.2 units vs. -0.4±0.3 units: p=0.03). After weight loss with diet M, both genotypes (GG vs. GT±TT) showed similar decrease in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Only subjects with GG genotype showed a significant increase of the adiponectin levels after both diets: (Diet P: 9.3±3.0 ng/dl vs. Diet M: 8.2±2.9 ng/dl: p=0.38).

Mediterranean-style diet for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.,Rees K; Takeda A; Martin N; Ellis L; Wijesekara D; Vepa A; Das A; Hartley L; Stranges S,"BACKGROUND: The Seven Countries study in the 1960s showed that populations in the Mediterranean region experienced lower coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality probably as a result of different dietary patterns. Later observational studies have confirmed the benefits of adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors but clinical trial evidence is more limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of a Mediterranean-style diet for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 25 September 2018); Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2018 week 39); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters, 1900 to 26 September 2018); DARE Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library); HTA Issue 4 of 4, 2016 (Cochrane Library); NHS EED Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library). We searched trial registers and applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). Both of the following key components were required to reach our definition of a Mediterranean-style diet: high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, usual care or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow-up periods of three months or more defined as the intervention period plus post intervention follow-up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted four main comparisons:1. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention;2. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention;3. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus usual care for secondary prevention;4. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention. MAIN RESULTS: In this substantive review update, 30 RCTs (49 papers) (12,461 participants randomised) and seven ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. The majority of trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (nine trials) and 2 (13 trials). Secondary prevention trials were included for comparison 3 (two trials) and comparison 4 (four trials plus an additional two trials that were excluded from the main analyses due to published concerns regarding the reliability of the data).Two trials reported on adverse events where these were absent or minor (low- to moderate-quality evidence). No trials reported on costs or health-related quality of life.Primary preventionThe included studies for comparison 1 did not report on clinical endpoints (CVD mortality, total mortality or non-fatal endpoints such as myocardial infarction or stroke). The PREDIMED trial (included in comparison 2) was retracted and re-analysed following concerns regarding randomisation at two of 11 sites. Low-quality evidence shows little or no effect of the PREDIMED (7747 randomised) intervention (advice to follow a Mediterranean diet plus supplemental extra-virgin olive oil or tree nuts) compared to a low-fat diet on CVD mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.32) or total mortality (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24) over 4.8 years. There was, however, a reduction in the number of strokes with the PREDIMED intervention (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.80), a decrease from 24/1000 to 14/1000 (95% CI 11 to 19), moderate-quality evidence). For CVD risk factors for comparison 1 there was low-quality evidence for a possible small reduction in total cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.00) and moderate-quality evidence for a reduction in systolic (-2.99 mmHg (95% CI -3.45 to -2.53) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.0 mmHg, 95% CI -2.29 to -1.71), with low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. For comparison 2 there was moderate-quality evidence of a possible small reduction in LDL cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.02) and triglycerides (-0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) with moderate or low-quality evidence of little or no effect on total or HDL cholesterol or blood pressure.Secondary preventionFor secondary prevention, the Lyon Diet Heart Study (comparison 3) examined the effect of advice to follow a Mediterranean diet and supplemental canola margarine compared to usual care in 605 CHD patients over 46 months and there was low-quality evidence of a reduction in adjusted estimates for CVD mortality (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.82) and total mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.92) with the intervention. Only one small trial (101 participants) provided unadjusted estimates for composite clinical endpoints for comparison 4 (very low-quality evidence of uncertain effect). For comparison 3 there was low-quality evidence of little or no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on lipid levels and very low-quality evidence for blood pressure. Similarly, for comparison 4 where only two trials contributed to the analyses there was low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect of the intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively large number of studies included in this review, there is still some uncertainty regarding the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on clinical endpoints and CVD risk factors for both primary and secondary prevention. The quality of evidence for the modest benefits on CVD risk factors in primary prevention is low or moderate, with a small number of studies reporting minimal harms. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention. The ongoing studies may provide more certainty in the future.",2019,Mar,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,3,3,CD009825,,10.1002/14651858.CD009825.pub3,30864165,#11398,Rees 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong article type; ,Narrative review
Common polymorphism in the cannabinoid receptor gene type 2 (CB2R) rs3123554 are associated with metabolic changes after two different hypocaloric diets with different dietary fatty profiles.,Aller R; Primo D; Izaola O; de Luis DA,"BACKGROUND: The role of CB2R gene variants on weight loss after a dietary intervention has been investigated in few studies. OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the effect of this genetic variant (rs3123554) of CB2R gene on cardiovascular risk factors and weight loss secondary to high monounsaturated fat vs a high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diets. DESIGN: A Caucasian population of 362 obese patients was enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated during 3 months to one of two diets (Diet P high polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fat hypocaloric diet vs, Diet M high monounsaturated (MUFAs) fat hypocaloric diet). RESULTS: In both genotype groups (GG vs GA+AA), body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure decreased after diet P and M. Body weight, BMI, fat mass and waist circumference were higher in A allele carriers than non A allele carriers. The improvement of these parameters was higher in non A allele carriers than A allele carriers. In non A allele carriers with both diets, the decrease of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, insulin and HOMA-IR was higher than A allele carriers after both diets. After diet P, triglyceride levels decrease in non A allele carriers. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that carriers of the minor allele of rs3123554 variant of CB2R gene lose less body weight during to different hypocaloric diets with different fatty acid. Moreover, non A-allele carriers showed a better response of LDL-cholesterol, HOMA-IR and insulin levels than A-carriers with both hypocaloric diets.",2019,Dec,Clin Nutr,38,6,2632-2638,,10.1016/j.clnu.2018.11.013,30528951,#11399,Aller 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

Detailed dietary information was assessed at baseline and yearly during the follow-up using a food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate T2D HRs and 95% CIs according to baseline and yearly updated fat intake.Results: We documented 266 incident cases during 4.3 y of follow-up. Baseline saturated and animal fat intake was not associated with the risk of T2D. After multivariable adjustment, participants in the highest quartile of updated intake of saturated and animal fat had a higher risk of diabetes than the lowest quartile (HR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.73; and P-trend = 0.01 compared with HR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.29, 3.09; and P-trend < 0.01, respectively). In both the Mediterranean diet and control groups, participants in the highest quartile of updated animal fat intake had an ∼2-fold higher risk of T2D than their counterparts in the lowest quartile. The consumption of 1 serving of butter and cheese was associated with a higher risk of diabetes, whereas whole-fat yogurt intake was associated with a lower risk.Conclusions: In a Mediterranean trial focused on dietary fat interventions, baseline intake of saturated and animal fat was not associated with T2D incidence, but the yearly updated intake of saturated and animal fat was associated with a higher risk of T2D.

Intake of individual saturated fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease in US men and women: two prospective longitudinal cohort studies.,Zong G; Li Y; Wanders AJ; Alssema M; Zock PL; Willett WC; Hu FB; Sun Q,"OBJECTIVES:  To investigate the association between long term intake of individual saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and the risk of coronary heart disease, in two large cohort studies. DESIGN:  Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. SETTING:  Health professionals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS:  73 147 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2012) and 42 635 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010), who were free of major chronic diseases at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:  Incidence of coronary heart disease (n=7035) was self-reported, and related deaths were identified by searching National Death Index or through report of next of kin or postal authority. Cases were confirmed by medical records review. RESULTS:  Mean intake of SFAs accounted for 9.0-11.3% energy intake over time, and was mainly composed of lauric acid (12:0), myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), and stearic acid (18:0; 8.8-10.7% energy). Intake of 12:0, 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0 were highly correlated, with Spearman correlation coefficients between 0.38 and 0.93 (all P<0.001). Comparing the highest to the lowest groups of individual SFA intakes, hazard ratios of coronary heart disease were 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.15; P(trend)=0.05) for 12:0, 1.13 (1.05 to 1.22; P(trend)<0.001) for 14:0, 1.18 (1.09 to 1.27; P(trend)<0.001) for 16:0, 1.18 (1.09 to 1.28; P(trend)<0.001) for 18:0, and 1.18 (1.09 to 1.28; P(trend)<0.001) for all four SFAs combined (12:0-18:0), after multivariate adjustment of lifestyle factors and total energy intake. Hazard ratios of coronary heart disease for isocaloric replacement of 1% energy from 12:0-18:0 were 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.96; P<0.001) for polyunsaturated fat, 0.95 (0.90 to 1.01; P=0.08) for monounsaturated fat, 0.94 (0.91 to 0.97; P<0.001) for whole grain carbohydrates, and 0.93 (0.89 to 0.97; P=0.001) for plant proteins. For individual SFAs, the lowest risk of coronary heart disease was observed when the most abundant SFA, 16:0, was replaced. Hazard ratios of coronary heart disease for replacing 1% energy from 16:0 were 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96; P=0.002) for polyunsaturated fat, 0.92 (0.83 to 1.02; P=0.10) for monounsaturated fat, 0.90 (0.83 to 0.97; P=0.01) for whole grain carbohydrates, and 0.89 (0.82 to 0.97; P=0.01) for plant proteins. CONCLUSIONS:  Higher dietary intakes of major SFAs are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Owing to similar associations and high correlations among individual SFAs, dietary recommendations for the prevention of coronary heart disease should continue to focus on replacing total saturated fat with more healthy sources of energy.",2016,Nov,BMJ,355,,i5796,,10.1136/bmj.i5796,27881409,#11409,Zong 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Inflammation mediates the association between fatty acid intake and depression in older men and women.,Lai JS; Oldmeadow C; Hure AJ; McEvoy M; Hiles SA; Boyle M; Attia J,"Antioxidants and fatty acids are associated with depression and inflammation, and inflammation appears to predict depression risk; hence, the associations between these nutrients and depression may be mediated by inflammation. We hypothesized that inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) mediate the associations between antioxidant and fatty acid intakes, and depression. Participants were from the Hunter Community Study, a longitudinal cohort of adults aged 55-85 years. Dietary intake was assessed using the Older Australian's Food Frequency Questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were drawn for analysis of nutrient and inflammatory biomarkers. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale at baseline and at 5-year follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to investigate longitudinal associations between dietary intakes and depression, and mediation analyses were carried out to determine if IL-6 and/or CRP were the mediators. Analyses were conducted on men and women separately and adjusted for potential confounders. Fruit and monounsaturated fat intakes were negatively associated with depression, whereas total fat and saturated fat intakes were positively associated with depression in both sexes. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fat was inversely associated with depression in men only. IL-6 was a significant mediator of the association between fruits with low carotenoid content and depression in women. CRP significantly mediated the relationship between total fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat intakes and depression in women, and saturated fat intake and depression in men. Our findings raise the possibility that the association between fatty acid intake and depression is partially mediated by inflammatory markers.",2016,Mar,Nutr Res,36,3,234-45,,10.1016/j.nutres.2015.11.017,26923510,#11415,Lai 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Diabetes in Asian Indians-How much is preventable? Ten-year follow-up of the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES-142).,Anjana RM; Sudha V; Nair DH; Lakshmipriya N; Deepa M; Pradeepa R; Shanthirani CS; Subhashini S; Malik V; Unnikrishnan R; Binu VS; Patel SA; Hu FB; Mohan V,"We sought to evaluate the contribution of various modifiable risk factors to the partial population attributable risk (PARp) for diabetes in an Asian Indian population. Of a cohort of 3589 individuals, representative of Chennai, India, followed up after a period of ten years, we analyzed data from 1376 individuals who were free of diabetes at baseline. A diet risk score was computed incorporating intake of refined cereals, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and monounsaturated fatty acid. Abdominal obesity was found to contribute the most to incident diabetes [Relative Risk (RR) 1.63(95%CI 1.21-2.20)]; (PARp 41.1% (95%CI 28.1-52.6)].

Childhood energy intake is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adolescents.,Anderson EL; Howe LD; Fraser A; Macdonald-Wallis C; Callaway MP; Sattar N; Day C; Tilling K; Lawlor DA,"BACKGROUND: Greater adiposity is an important risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, it is likely that dietary intake is involved in the development of the disease. Prospective studies assessing the relation between childhood dietary intake and risk of NAFLD are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to explore associations between energy, carbohydrate, sugar, starch, protein, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, saturated fat, and total fat intake by youth at ages 3, 7, and 13 y and subsequent (mean age: 17.8 y) ultrasound scan (USS)-measured liver fat and stiffness and serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyltransferase. We assessed whether observed associations were mediated through fat mass at the time of outcome assessment. METHODS: Participants were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Trajectories of energy and macronutrient intake from ages 3-13 y were obtained with linear-spline multilevel models. Linear and logistic regression models examined whether energy intake and absolute and energy-adjusted macronutrient intake at ages 3, 7, and 13 y were associated with liver outcomes. RESULTS: Energy intake at all ages was positively associated with liver outcomes; for example, the odds of having a USS-measured liver fat per 100 kcal increase in energy intake at age 3 y were 1.79 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.79). Associations between absolute macronutrient intake and liver outcomes were inconsistent and attenuated to the null after adjustment for total energy intake. The majority of associations attenuated to the null after adjustment for fat mass at the time liver outcomes were assessed.

We applied a ""nutrient-wide association study"" approach to systematically evaluate dietary risk associations for endometrial cancer while controlling for multiple hypothesis tests using the false discovery rate (FDR) and validating the results in an independent cohort. We evaluated endometrial cancer risk associations for dietary intake of 84 foods and nutrients based on dietary questionnaires in three prospective studies, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC; N = 1,303 cases) followed by validation of nine foods/nutrients (FDR ≤ 0.10) in the Nurses' Health Studies (NHS/NHSII; N = 1,531 cases). Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). In multivariate adjusted comparisons of the extreme categories of intake at baseline, coffee was inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk (EPIC, median intake 750 g/day vs. 8.6; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.97, Ptrend = 0.09; NHS/NHSII, median intake 1067 g/day vs. none; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96, Ptrend = 0.04). Eight other dietary factors that were associated with endometrial cancer risk in the EPIC study (total fat, monounsaturated fat, carbohydrates, phosphorus, butter, yogurt, cheese, and potatoes) were not confirmed in the NHS/NHSII. Our findings suggest that coffee intake may be inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk. Further data are needed to confirm these findings and to examine the mechanisms linking coffee intake to endometrial cancer risk to develop improved prevention strategies.",2015,Feb,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,24,2,466-71,,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0970,25662427,#11420,Merritt 2015,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Relation of -55CT polymorphism of UCP3 gene with weight loss and metabolic changes after a high monounsaturated fat diet in obese non diabetic patients.,De Luis DA; Aller R; Izaola O; De La Fuente B; Conde R; Eiros Bouza JM,"AIMS: The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of -55CT polymorphism of UCP3 gene on metabolic response, weight loss and serum adipokine levels to a high monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet in obese patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sample of 128 obese patients was analyzed in a prospective way during 3 months. RESULTS: Eighty eight patients (21 males/67 females) (68.8%) had the genotype 55CC (wild genotype group) and 40 patients (8 males/32 females) (31.3%) 55CT (mutant genotype group). In wild genotype group, BMI (-1.6±1.3 kg/m2), weight (-4.3±3.7 kg), fat mass (-3.5±3.3 kg), waist circumference (-5.1±2.9 cm), total cholesterol (-7.2±10.6 mg/dl), LDL cholesterol (-5.3±12.8 mg/dl) and leptin (-4.7±10.1 ng/ml) decreased.

Genetic variation in the beta 3-adrenoreceptor gene (Trp64Arg polymorphism) and its influence on anthropometric parameters and insulin resistance under a high monounsaturated versus a high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet.,de Luis DA; Aller R; Izaola O; Conde R; Eiros Bouza JM,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate the role of Trp64Arg polymorphism of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3-AR) gene on metabolic changes and weight loss secondary to a high monounsaturated fat versus a high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet in obese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population of 260 obese subjects was analyzed. In the basal visit, patients were randomly allocated for 3 months to either diet M (high monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet) or diet P (high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the positive effects (on weight, body mass index, waist circumference, fat mass) in either genotype group with both diets.

A low-fat high-carbohydrate diet supplemented with long-chain n-3 PUFA reduces the risk of the metabolic syndrome.,Paniagua JA; Pérez-Martinez P; Gjelstad IM; Tierney AC; Delgado-Lista J; Defoort C; Blaak EE; Risérus U; Drevon CA; Kiec-Wilk B; Lovegrove JA; Roche HM; López-Miranda J,"OBJECTIVE: Dietary changes are major factor in determining cardiovascular risk. We assessed the effects of isoenergetic diets with different fat quantity and quality on the incidence and regression of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) from the LIPGENE project. METHODS AND DESIGN: Clinical intervention study: the patients (n=337) were randomly assigned to one of four diets for 12 weeks each: two high fat diets, one rich in saturated fat (HSFA) and the other rich in monounsaturated fat (HMUFA), and two low fat diets, one high in complex carbohydrates (LFHCC) supplemented with 1.24g/day of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LFHCC n-3) and the other LFHCC diet with placebo (LFHCC). MEASUREMENTS: the effects on MetS risk criteria were recorded before and after the intervention period. RESULTS: An enlarged waist circumference (≥88cm for women and ≥102cm for men) was present among 95% of the participants, 88% had elevated blood pressure (>130/85mm Hg or antihypertensive drugs), 77% had elevated fasting plasma glucose (≥5.55mmol/L), 51% were hypertriacylglycerolemic (≥1.7mmol/L), and 72% had low HDL cholesterol (<1.0mmol/L for men, and <1.3mmol/L for women). The prevalence of enlarged waist circumference, hypertension and hypertriacylglycerolemia were reduced after the LFHCC n-3 diet (p<0.05). Thus the prevalence of MetS fell by 20.5% after LFHCC n-3 diet compared with the HSFA (10.6%), HMUFA (12%) diet or LFHCC (10.4%) diets (p<0.028).

"Dietary fat, fiber, and carbohydrate intake and endogenous hormone levels in premenopausal women.",Cui X; Rosner B; Willett WC; Hankinson SE,"The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the associations of fat, fiber, and carbohydrate intake with endogenous estrogen, androgen, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) levels among 595 premenopausal women. Overall, no significant associations were found between dietary intake of these macronutrients and plasma sex steroid hormone levels. Dietary fat intake was inversely associated with IGF-I and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels. When substituting 5% of energy from total fat for the equivalent amount of energy from carbohydrate or protein intake, the plasma levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3, 5.3) and 1.6% (95% CI 0.4, 2.8) lower, respectively. Animal fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat intakes also were inversely associated with IGFBP-3 levels (P<0.05). Carbohydrates were positively associated with plasma IGF-I level. When substituting 5% of energy from carbohydrates for the equivalent amount of energy from fat or protein intake, the plasma IGF-I level was 2.0% (95% CI 0.1, 3.9%) higher. No independent associations between fiber intake and hormone levels were observed. The results suggest that a low-fat/high-fiber or carbohydrate diet is not associated with endogenous levels of sex steroid hormones, but it may modestly increase IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels among premenopausal women.",2010,Oct,Horm Cancer,1,5,265-76,,10.1007/s12672-010-0050-6,21761370,#11435,Cui 2010,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Associations between healthy eating patterns and indicators of metabolic risk in postmenopausal women.,Tardivo AP; Nahas-Neto J; Nahas EA; Maesta N; Rodrigues MA; Orsatti FL,"BACKGROUND: Since human diets contain many components that may work synergistically to prevent or promote disease, assessing diet quality may be informative. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between quality diet, by using Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and metabolic risk indicators in postmenopausal women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a total of 173 Brazilian women, aged 45-75 years, seeking healthcare at a public outpatient center. Food consumption assessed by 24 h-recall food inquiry was used to calculate HEI scores: >80 implied diet good, 80-51 diet ""needed improvement"", and <51 diet poor. Anthropometric data included: body mass index (BMI = weight/height(2)), waist-circumference (WC), body fat (%BF) and lean mass (%LM). Data on total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and triglycerides (TG) were also collected. Fisher's Exact test, and logistic regression method (to determine odds ratio, OR) were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Overweight and obesity were observed in 75.7% of the participants. Excessive %BF (> 35%) was observed in 56.1%, while %LM was reduced (< 70%) in 78.1%. WC was elevated (≥88 cm) in 72.3%. Based on HEI values, diet quality was good in 3% (5/173), needed improvement in 48.5% (84/173), and was poor in 48.5% (84/173) of the cases. In this group, 75% of women had high intakes of lipids (> 35%), predominantly saturated and monounsaturated fat. On average, plasma TC, LDLC, and TG levels were higher than recommended in 57.2%, 79.2% and 45.1% of the women, respectively, while HDLC was low in 50.8%. There was association between HEI scores and the %BF that it was higher among women with HEI score < 80 (p = 0.021). There were not observed significant risk associations between HEI and lipid profile. CONCLUSION: Among the Brazilian postmenopausal women attending a public outpatient clinic, diet was considered to need improvement or to be of poor quality, attributed to high saturated fat ingestion, which probably caused a negative impact on metabolic risk indicators, namely body composition.",2010,Dec,Nutr J,9,,64,,10.1186/1475-2891-9-64,21143838,#11441,Tardivo 2010,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Impact of exercise and dietary fatty acid composition from a high-fat diet on markers of hunger and satiety.,Cooper JA; Watras AC; Paton CM; Wegner FH; Adams AK; Schoeller DA,"To compare the effects of both dietary fatty acid composition and exercise vs. sedentary conditions on circulating levels of hunger and satiety hormones. Eight healthy males were randomized in a 2 × 2 crossover design. The four treatments were 3 days of HF diets (50% of energy) containing high saturated fat (22% of energy) with exercise (SE) or sedentary (SS) conditions, and high monounsaturated fat (30% of energy) with exercise (UE) or sedentary (US) conditions. Cycling exercise was completed at 45% of VO(2)max for 2h daily. On the third HF day, 20 blood samples were drawn over a 24h period for each hormone (leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and peptide YY (PYY)). A visual analog scale (VAS) was completed hourly between 0800 and 2200. Average 24h leptin and insulin levels were lower while 24h PYY was higher during exercise vs. sedentary conditions. FA composition did not differentially affect 24h hormone values. VAS scores for hunger and fullness did not differ between any treatment but did correlate with ghrelin, leptin, and insulin. High saturated or unsaturated fat diets did not differ with respect to markers of hunger or satiety.

Diet determines features of the metabolic syndrome in 6- to 14-year-old children.,Aeberli I; Spinas GA; Lehmann R; l'Allemand D; Molinari L; Zimmermann MB,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Insulin resistance (IR) and hypertension are common in overweight children, and the adipocyte-derived hormones resistin, adiponectin, and leptin may modulate IR and blood pressure (BP). Few data exist in children on dietary determinants of IR, BP, or leptin, and no data exist on dietary determinants of resistin and adiponectin. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate dietary determinants of IR, BP, resistin, adiponectin, and leptin concentrations, as well as the interrelationship among these variables, in normal and overweight children. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In 6- to 14-year-old Swiss children (n=79), nutritional intake was assessed using two 24-hour-recalls and a one-day dietary record. Body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BF%), waist/hip ratio (W/H ratio), BP, glucose, insulin, resistin, adiponectin, and leptin were determined. IR was calculated using the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). RESULTS: BMI, BF%, and W/H ratio were significant predictors of leptin and insulin, QUICKI, and systolic BP, but not resistin or adiponectin. Of the overweight and obese children, 40% were diagnosed pre-hypertensive or hypertensive. Total energy, fat, saturated fat, and protein intakes were significant predictors of fasting insulin and QUICKI, and total fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat intakes were significant predictors of systolic BP, independent of BMI standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) and age. There were no associations between these dietary factors and leptin, adiponectin, or resistin. CONCLUSION: In children, dietary macronutrient composition is a predictor of IR and systolic BP, but not resistin, adiponectin, or leptin concentrations.

Body mass index and nutritional intake in patients with HIV and chronic diarrhea: a secondary analysis.,Capili B; Anastasi JK,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in nutritional intake and body mass index (BMI) in HIV patients with chronic diarrhea via secondary analysis of patients' nutritional diaries. A secondary purpose was to evaluate the quality of diets against national dietary guidelines. DATA SOURCES: Seventy-five ambulatory patients with HIV were included in this study. Patients were categorized using baseline BMI as normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI >or=30.0 kg/m2). Seven-day nutritional diaries were used to estimate diet in terms of dietary fats, cholesterol, fiber, protein, and sugar. A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the relationship between BMI and mean nutritional intake from fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, and sugar. CONCLUSIONS: 39.7% and 13.3% of participants were overweight and obese, respectively. The mean intake of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol was higher than the recommended levels by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), while the mean intake of monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and fiber was below the NCEP guideline. Although the results were not statistically different between groups, grams of fiber intake were lowest for individuals with BMI >or=30.0 kg/m2.

Low glycaemic index diet and disposition index in type 2 diabetes (the Canadian trial of carbohydrates in diabetes): a randomised controlled trial.,Wolever TM; Mehling C; Chiasson JL; Josse RG; Leiter LA; Maheux P; Rabasa-Lhoret R; Rodger NW; Ryan EA,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We recently found that oral glucose tolerance over 1 year in type 2 diabetic patients declined to a significantly lesser degree on a low-glycaemic-index than on a reduced-carbohydrate diet. Here, we examined whether that finding was associated with an improvement in disposition index, an index of beta cell function defined as the product of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Since this is a report of secondary analysis on a previously published trial, the results should be considered as hypothesis-generating. METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients treated by diet alone (n = 162) were randomised by computer to high-carbohydrate/high-glycaemic index (High-GI, n = 52), high-carbohydrate/low-glycaemic index (Low-GI, n = 56) or low-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated-fat (Low-CHO, n = 54) diets for 1 year in a multi-centre, parallel-design clinical trial conducted at University teaching hospitals. At baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months participants underwent 75 g OGTTs; 27 participants dropped out or were excluded. Indices of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and disposition index, derived from the OGTT, were compared among diets. Those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment. RESULTS: Neither muscle insulin sensitivity index nor insulinogenic index differed significantly among diets. However, a significant time x diet interaction existed for disposition index (muscle insulin sensitivity index x insulinogenic index) (p = 0.036). After 3 months, disposition index tended to be higher on Low-CHO than on Low-GI diets, namely by 0.07 h(-1) (95% CI -0.04, 0.18). However, by 12 months this reversed and disposition index became higher on Low-GI than on Low-CHO, namely by 0.12 h(-1) (0.01, 0.23; p < 0.05, baseline disposition index 0.23 h(-1)). There were no important adverse effects associated with the treatments.

A modified Mediterranean diet is associated with the greatest reduction in alanine aminotransferase levels in obese type 2 diabetes patients: results of a quasi-randomised controlled trial.,Fraser A; Abel R; Lawlor DA; Fraser D; Elhayany A,"AIM: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of different dietary interventions on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in obese patients with diabetes. METHODS: A post hoc analysis of an open label, parallel design, quasi-randomised (allocation by alternation), controlled trial, conducted in Israel. Obese patients with diabetes (n = 259), treated in the community, were centrally allocated to one of three diets: (1) the 2003 recommended American Diabetes Association diet (ADA): 50-55% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 20% protein, n = 85; (2) a low glycaemic index (LGI) diet: 50-55% LGI carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15-20% protein, n = 89; or (3) a modified Mediterranean diet (MMD): 35% LGI carbohydrate, 45% fat that was high in monounsaturated fat, 15-20% protein, n = 85. ALT was measured at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: ALT levels decreased in all arms; however, the MMD was associated with the lowest ALT levels at month 6 (n = 201: ADA n = 64, LGI n = 73, MMD n = 64) and month 12 of follow-up (n = 179). At 12 months mean ALT levels were 19.8 +/- 1.4 U/l in the ADA diet arm (n = 54), 18.0 +/- 1.5 U/l in the LGI diet arm (n = 64) and 14.4 +/- 1.7 in the MMD arm (n = 61, p < 0.001). Evidence for an effect of diet on ALT levels persisted when controlling for post-randomisation changes in waist to hip ratio, BMI, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) or triacylglycerol. CONCLUSIONS: A Mediterranean diet may have a beneficial effect on liver steatosis in obese patients with diabetes.

Effects of a vegetarian diet and treatment preference on biochemical and dietary variables in overweight and obese adults: a randomized clinical trial.,Burke LE; Hudson AG; Warziski MT; Styn MA; Music E; Elci OU; Sereika SM,"BACKGROUND: A vegetarian diet may lead to numerous health benefits, including weight loss. OBJECTIVE: We examined the joint effects of personal preference of dietary treatment and a calorie-restricted, low-fat lactoovovegetarian diet (LOV-D) compared with a standard calorie-restricted, low-fat omnivorous diet (STD-D) on changes in weight, total cholesterol, ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol (LDL:HDL cholesterol), triacylglycerols, insulin resistance, and macronutrient intake during an 18-mo study. DESIGN: This was a randomized clinical trial of 176 overweight and obese adults who were recruited and randomly assigned first to 1 of 2 preference conditions (yes or no). If assigned to Preference-No, they were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 diet conditions (STD-D or LOV-D). If assigned to Preference-Yes, they were assigned to the diet they indicated as preferred at screening. The 12-mo intervention was followed by a 6-mo maintenance phase. RESULTS: Participants were mainly women (86.9%) and white (70.5%); 75% completed the 18-mo study. A significant interaction between preference and dietary treatment was not observed for any of the outcome variables. However, participants in the Preference-No groups significantly decreased their triacylglycerols (P = 0.04). The only effect observed for diet was a borderline significant decrease in LDL:HDL cholesterol for the LOV-D group (P = 0.06). Within the LOV-D groups, those who were 100% adherent to the LOV-D had significant and marginally significant reductions in monounsaturated fat (P = 0.02) and total fat (P = 0.05) intakes at 18 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neither prescribing a vegetarian diet nor allowing persons to choose their preferred diet had a significant effect on outcome measures.

Dietary fatty acid intakes and the risk of ovulatory infertility.,Chavarro JE; Rich-Edwards JW; Rosner BA; Willett WC,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacologic activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) improves ovulatory function in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and specific dietary fatty acids can affect PPAR-gamma activity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess whether the intakes of total fat, cholesterol, and major types of fatty acids affect the risk of ovulatory infertility. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 18 555 married, premenopausal women without a history of infertility who attempted a pregnancy or became pregnant between 1991 and 1999. Diet was assessed twice during follow-up by using a food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: During follow-up, 438 incidents of ovulatory infertility were reported. In logistic regression analyses, intakes of total fat, cholesterol, and most types of fatty acids were not related to ovulatory infertility. Each 2% increase in the intake of energy from trans unsaturated fats, as opposed to that from carbohydrates, was associated with a 73% greater risk of ovulatory infertility after adjustment for known and suspected risk factors for this condition [relative risk (RR) = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.73]. Obtaining 2% of energy intake from trans fats rather than from n-6 polyunsaturated fats was associated with a similar increase in the risk of ovulatory infertility (RR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.89). In addition, obtaining 2% of energy from trans fats rather than from monounsaturated fats was associated with a more than doubled risk of ovulatory infertility (RR = 2.31; 95% CI: 1.09, 4.87).

Patients with CF showed higher energy intakes (110 +/- 43 kcal/d) compared with controls (75 +/- 22 kcal/d; P < 0.0001), with higher intake of total (saturated and monounsaturated) fats and lower intake of polyunsaturated FA (3.9 +/- 1.0% of total macronutrient intake vs 4.3 +/- 1.2%, P = 0.05). In CF patients, plasma and PL levels of linoleic and docosahexaenoic acids were lower, whereas those of arachidonic acid were similar compared with controls. The Shwachman score showed significant positive associations with plasma PL levels of arachidonic acid and total n-6 long-chain FA (r = 0.32, P = 0.05, and r = 0.35, P = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The data give suggestions that fat intake and CF-associated biomechanisms are bound in a vicious circle, concurring to create the clinical and biochemical picture of CF. The quantity and quality of fat supplementation in CF need careful attention to balance the fat supply with polyunsaturated FA.",2006,Nov,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,43,5,660-5,,10.1097/01.mpg.0000235978.59873.04,17130745,#11467,Colombo 2006,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fat intake is associated with psychosocial and cognitive functioning of school-aged children in the United States.,Zhang J; Hebert JR; Muldoon MF,"Using cross-sectional data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey, 1988-1994, we examined whether dietary fat intake is associated with cognitive and psychosocial functioning in school-aged children. Based upon 24-h diet recall interviews, dietary intakes of total fat, SFA, monounsaturated fatty, PUFAs, and cholesterol were estimated in 3666 participants aged 6 to 16 y. Psychosocial functioning was evaluated in interviews of each child's mother. Cognitive functioning was measured using achievement and intelligence tests. Overall, total fat and saturated fat were unrelated to measures of cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Compared with equivalent energy intake from saturated fat or carbohydrate, each 5% increase in energy intake from PUFAs was associated with lower risks of poor performance on the digit span test (replacing SFA, OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.37-0.91; replacing carbohydrate, OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.43-0.88). Cholesterol intake was associated with an increased risk of poor performance on the digit span test (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11-1.42 for each 100-mg increment intake of cholesterol). The associations were independent of socioeconomic status, maternal education and marital status, and children's nutrition status and were consistent across different methods of energy adjustment in regression models. We conclude that high intake of PUFAs may contribute to an improved performance on the digit span test. In contrast, increased intake of cholesterol may be associated with a poorer performance.",2005,Aug,J Nutr,135,8,1967-73,,10.1093/jn/135.8.1967,16046724,#11470,Zhang 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Interactions of dietary fat intake and the hepatic lipase -480C-->T polymorphism in determining hepatic lipase activity: the Hoorn Study.,Bos G; Dekker JM; Feskens EJ; Ocke MC; Nijpels G; Stehouwer CD; Bouter LM; Heine RJ; Jansen H,"BACKGROUND: Gene-nutrient interactions affecting hepatic lipase (HL) activity may contribute to the interindividual variability of the cardiovascular disease risk associated with dietary fat intake. OBJECTIVE: We determined the associations of dietary fat intake with postheparin HL activity and the possible modifying effect of the HL -480C-->T polymorphism on these associations. DESIGN: Subjects were recruited from participants in the 2000-2001 follow-up examination of the Hoorn Study. HL activity was determined in postheparin plasma in a sample of 211 men and 218 women aged 60-87 y. Information about dietary intake of the participants was obtained with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Linear regression was performed, adjusted for age. RESULTS: Total dietary fat was positively associated with HL activity (standardized beta: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.21), and this association was also seen for saturated fat (0.10; 0.01, 0.20) and monounsaturated fatty acid (0.10; 0.01, 0.19). We observed a significant interaction of the HL polymorphism with the relation between total fat intake and HL activity. The association of total fat with HL activity was stronger in subjects with CT (0.27; 0.11, 0.43) and TT (0.39; -0.22, 1.00) genotypes than in subjects with the CC genotype (0.06; -0.06, 0.18; P for interaction < 0.10). The interaction remained statistically significant in models that included age, sex, carbohydrate and protein intakes, and insulin or body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intakes of total and saturated fat were positively associated with higher HL activity. In addition, the observed association of total fat with HL activity was modified by the HL-480C-->T polymorphism, after adjustment for age, sex, carbohydrate and protein intakes, and insulin or body mass index.",2005,Apr,Am J Clin Nutr,81,4,911-5,,10.1093/ajcn/81.4.911,15817871,#11471,Bos 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Carbohydrate-restricted diets high in either monounsaturated fat or protein are equally effective at promoting fat loss and improving blood lipids.,Luscombe-Marsh ND; Noakes M; Wittert GA; Keogh JB; Foster P; Clifton PM,"BACKGROUND: When substituted for carbohydrate in an energy-reduced diet, dietary protein enhances fat loss in women. It is unknown whether the effect is due to increased protein or reduced carbohydrate. OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of 2 isocaloric diets that differed in protein and fat content on weight loss, lipids, appetite regulation, and energy expenditure after test meals. DESIGN: This was a parallel, randomized study in which subjects received either a low-fat, high-protein (LF-HP) diet (29 +/- 1% fat, 34 +/- 0.8% protein) or a high-fat, standard-protein (HF-SP) diet (45 +/- 0.6% fat, 18 +/- 0.3% protein) during 12 wk of energy restriction (6 +/- 0.1 MJ/d) and 4 wk of energy balance (7.4 +/- 0.3 MJ/d). Fifty-seven overweight and obese [mean body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 33.8 +/- 0.9] volunteers with insulin concentrations >12 mU/L completed the study. RESULTS: Weight loss (LF-HP group, 9.7 +/- 1.1 kg; HF-SP group, 10.2 +/- 1.4 kg; P = 0.78) and fat loss were not significantly different between diet groups even though the subjects desired less to eat after the LF-HP meal (P = 0.02). The decrease in resting energy expenditure was not significantly different between diet groups (LF-HP, -342 +/- 185 kJ/d; HF-SP, -349 +/- 220 kJ/d). The decrease in the thermic effect of feeding with weight loss was smaller in the LF-HP group than in the HF-SP group (-0.3 +/- 1.0% compared with -3.6 +/- 0.7%; P = 0.014). Glucose and insulin responses to test meals improved after weight loss (P < 0.001) with no significant diet effect. Bone turnover, inflammation, and calcium excretion did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of weight loss and the improvements in insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors did not differ significantly between the 2 diets, and neither diet had any detrimental effects on bone turnover or renal function.",2005,Apr,Am J Clin Nutr,81,4,762-72,,10.1093/ajcn/81.4.762,15817850,#11472,Luscombe-Marsh 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The national cholesterol education program diet vs a diet lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein and monounsaturated fat: a randomized trial.,Aude YW; Agatston AS; Lopez-Jimenez F; Lieberman EH; Marie Almon; Hansen M; Rojas G; Lamas GA; Hennekens CH,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, obesity is a major clinical and public health problem causing diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, as well as increasing cardiovascular and total mortality. Dietary restrictions of calories and saturated fat are beneficial. However, it remains unclear whether replacement of saturated fat with carbohydrates (as in the US National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] diet) or protein and monounsaturated fat (as in our isocaloric modified low-carbohydrate [MLC] diet, which is lower in total carbohydrates but higher in protein, monounsaturated fat, and complex carbohydrates) is optimal. METHODS: We randomized 60 participants (29 women and 31 men) to the NCEP or the MLC diet and evaluated them every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. They were aged 28 to 71 years (mean age, 44 years in the NCEP and 46 years in the MLC group). A total of 36% of participants from the NCEP group and 35% from the MLC group had a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) greater than 27. The primary end point was weight loss, and secondary end points were blood lipid levels and waist-to-hip ratio. RESULTS: Weight loss was significantly greater in the MLC (13.6 lb) than in the NCEP group (7.5 lb), a difference of 6.1 lb (P = .02). There were no significant differences between the groups for total, low density, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or the proportion of small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles. There were significantly favorable changes in all lipid levels within the MLC but not within the NCEP group. Waist-to-hip ratio was not significantly reduced between the groups (P = .27), but it significantly decreased within the MLC group (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the NCEP diet, the MLC diet, which is lower in total carbohydrates but higher in complex carbohydrates, protein, and monounsaturated fat, caused significantly greater weight loss over 12 weeks. There were no significant differences between the groups in blood lipid levels, but favorable changes were observed within the MLC diet group.",2004,Oct,Arch Intern Med,164,19,2141-6,,10.1001/archinte.164.19.2141,15505128,#11476,Aude 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effect of weight loss and lifestyle changes on vascular inflammatory markers in obese women: a randomized trial.,Esposito K; Pontillo A; Di Palo C; Giugliano G; Masella M; Marfella R; Giugliano D,"CONTEXT: Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which may be mediated by increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by adipose tissue. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a program of changes in lifestyle designed to obtain a sustained reduction of body weight on markers of systemic vascular inflammation and insulin resistance. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized single-blind trial conducted from February 1999 to February 2002 at a university hospital in Italy. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty premenopausal obese women (body mass index > or =30) aged 20 to 46 years without diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. INTERVENTIONS: The 60 women randomly assigned to the intervention group received detailed advice about how to achieve a reduction of weight of 10% or more through a low-energy Mediterranean-style diet and increased physical activity. The control group (n = 60) was given general information about healthy food choices and exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lipid and glucose intake; blood pressure; homeostatic model assessment of insulin sensitivity; and circulating levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 18 (IL-18), C-reactive protein (CRP), and adiponectin. RESULTS: After 2 years, women in the intervention group consumed more foods rich in complex carbohydrates (9% corrected difference; P<.001), monounsaturated fat (2%; P =.009), and fiber (7 g/d; P<.001); had a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (-5; P<.001); and had lower energy (-310 kcal/d; P<.001), saturated fat (-3.5%; P =.007), and cholesterol intake (-92 mg/d; P<.001) than controls. Body mass index decreased more in the intervention group than in controls (-4.2; P<.001), as did serum concentrations of IL-6 (-1.1 pg/mL; P =.009), IL-18 (-57 pg/mL; P =.02), and CRP (-1.6 mg/L; P =.008), while adiponectin levels increased significantly (2.2 microg/mL; P =.01). In multivariate analyses, changes in free fatty acids (P =.008), IL-6 (P =.02), and adiponectin (P =.007) levels were independently associated with changes in insulin sensitivity.

[Response degree of cholesterol LDL to feeding in males with hypercholesterolemia according to baseline value].,Fernández De La Puebla RA; Carmona J; Fuentes F; Marín C; Gómez P; López-Miranda J; Pérez-Jiménez F,"BACKGROUND: The response of plasma cholesterol to diet is modulated by endogenous and exogenous factors such as body mass, tobacco consumption, gender and the genetic background. Our purpose was to know whether the response degree depends on the concentration of cholesterol prior to the intervention and whether several polymorphisms modulating the cholesterol response to diet are actually involved in such response. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Seventy two males with hypercholesterolemia were administered three different 4-weeks duration diets. The first one was a saturated fat-enriched (SAT) diet. Then, in a randomized and crossed manner, subjects were categorized in two groups: one group received a diet with low fat but high complex carbohydrates contents (HCO); the another group received a monounsaturated fat-enriched diet (Mediterranean diet). In the third period, we inverted the diets of the previous period. We determined the prevalent genotypes of the following apoproteins: E, CIII, A-IV, A-I, B, A-IV 360. RESULTS: The diet with low fat contents and the Mediterranean diet led to a significant decrease of total cholesterol, LDL-c and HDL-c. Those at the upper LDL-c tertile, after the SAT diet, were found to have statistically significant greater decreases (absolute and relative values) with the Mediterranean and HCO diet. In the multivariate analysis, the only variable with an effect on the modification of LDL-c, after shifting a SAT to any hypolipidemic diet, were the levels of LDL-c at the end of a SAT diet. The allelic frequency of different apoproteins in the hyper-respondent group was not different from that in the hypo-respondent group (response displayed when going from a SAT period to any hypolipidemic diet). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of LDL-c observed with hypolipidemic diets (low in fat contents or Mediterranean) was more significant in those individuals with hypercholesterolemia who had higher levels of LDL-c at the onset.",2002,May,Med Clin (Barc),118,19,737-40,,,12049706,#11486,FernándezDeLaPuebla 2002,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Can dietary factors explain differences in serum cholesterol profiles among different ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays and Indians) in Singapore?",Deurenberg-Yap M; Li T; Tan WL; van Staveren WA; Chew SK; Deurenberg P,"In Singapore. there exists differences in risk factors for coronary heart disease among the three main ethnic groups: Chinese, Malays and Indians. This study aimed to investigate if differences in dietary intakes of fat, types of fat, cholesterol, fruits, vegetables and grain foods could explain the differences in serum cholesterol levels between the ethnic groups. A total of 2408 adult subjects (61.0% Chinese, 21.4% Malays and 17.6% Indians) were selected systematically from the subjects who took part in the National Health Survey in 1998. The design of the study was based on a cross-sectional study. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess intakes of energy, total fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, cholesterol, fruits, vegetables and cereal-based foods. The Hegsted score was calculated. Serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol were analysed and the ratio of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol was computed. The results showed that on a group level (six sex-ethnic groups), Hegsted score, dietary intakes of fat, satutrated fat, cholesterol, vegetables and grain foods were found to be correlated to serum cholesterol levels. However, selected dietary factors did not explain the differences in serum cholesterol levels between ethnic groups when multivariate regression analysis was performed, with adjustment for age, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, cigarette smoking, occupation, education level and physical activity level. This cross-sectional study shows that while selected dietary factors are correlated to serum cholesterol at a group level, they do not explain the differences in serum cholesterol levels between ethnic groups independently of age, obesity, occupation, educational level and other lifestyle risk factors.",2001,,Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,10,1,39-45,,10.1046/j.1440-6047.2001.00202.x,11708607,#11489,Deurenberg-Yap 2001,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The association of dietary fat and plant foods with endometrial cancer (United States).,Littman AJ; Beresford SA; White E,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations of dietary fat and selected plant foods with endometrial cancer in a population-based case-control study. METHODS: Six hundred and seventy-nine incident cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed between 1985 and 1991, and 944 population-based controls completed a 98-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire and a detailed in-person interview which collected information on endometrial cancer risk factors. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of endometrial cancer, adjusted for age, county, energy intake, hormone use, smoking and, in separate models, for body mass index (BMI: kg/m2). RESULTS: Percent energy from fat was associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer (highest quintile cf. lowest: OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.6), with saturated and monounsaturated fats being the main contributors of risk. There was a stronger association between dietary fat and endometrial cancer among groups with higher circulating estrogen levels (i.e. women with higher BMI, users of unopposed estrogens, non-smokers, and younger age at menarche). Consumption of fruits or vegetables was inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk (highest quintile cf. lowest: OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.93 and OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.88, respectively). Further adjustment for BMI resulted in little or no attenuation of the ORs and associated CIs. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the theory that a low-fat, high-fruit and high-vegetable diet may reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, and that these dietary factors may act independently of the effect of BMI.",2001,Oct,Cancer Causes Control,12,8,691-702,,10.1023/a:1011292003586,11562109,#11491,Littman 2001,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Impaired HDL response to fat in men with coronary artery disease.,Clifton PM; Noakes M,"A low HDL cholesterol is found frequently in subjects with premature coronary artery disease. We speculated that individuals with a normal total cholesterol and coronary artery disease have an impaired HDL response to dietary fat. Twenty-one men with recently diagnosed coronary artery disease and total plasma cholesterol of <6 mmol/l were matched by age, weight and cholesterol with 26 men with no personal or family history of coronary artery disease. They were placed sequentially on a 25% fat diet for 2 weeks, a high carbohydrate supplement which reduced fat to 16% of energy for 3 weeks and a high monounsaturated fat supplement which increased fat to 35% for a final 3-week period. Half of the subjects underwent an intravenous glucose tolerance test at the end of the intervention periods. The high fat supplement increased HDL cholesterol from 0.79 to 0.89 mmol/l in the men with coronary artery disease while HDL increased from 0.88 to 1.05 mmol/l in the control group (P<0.05 for group difference). Plasma triglyceride fell by 0.79 and 0.45 mmol/l in cases and controls respectively (P<0.05 for group difference). LDL cholesterol fell by 0.2 mmol/l in both groups. Men with coronary artery disease had an enhanced insulin response during the intravenous glucose tolerance test (P<0.03) particularly in the low fat phase. Thus men with premature coronary artery disease and a low HDL cholesterol appear to have an impaired elevation of HDL cholesterol in response to dietary fat, and insulin resistance may underlie this response.",2000,May,Atherosclerosis,150,1,159-65,,10.1016/s0021-9150(99)00363-9,10781647,#11499,Clifton 2000,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Modifiable risk factor levels of coronary heart disease survivors in a middle-aged workforce.,Metcalf PA; Scragg RK; Swinburn B,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is common in New Zealand. Risk factors for CHD are modifiable or non-modifiable. Modifiable risk factor levels of CHD survivors were compared with those without such a history (non-CHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants were from a cross-sectional survey of 5,656 workers aged > or = 40. CHD survivors were 73 general practitioner (GP)-confirmed participants with a history of hospitalisation for CHD. There were no significant differences in mean blood pressure levels between CHD survivors and non-CHD workers after adjusting for age, gender and ethnicity, but current use of antihypertensive medications was higher in CHD survivors (34.2%) than non-CHD workers (8.1%); p < 0.001. CHD survivors had higher, similarly adjusted, mean serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and lower HDL-cholesterol levels, and their reported carbohydrate, fibre, polyunsaturated fat intakes and ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat intakes were higher and total fat, saturated fat and monounsaturated fat intakes were lower. CHD survivors ate fewer servings of red meats per month and more servings of fruit, and cereal, and number of cups of milk. Salt added to meals was lower and margarine use higher in CHD survivors. There were no significant differences in the proportions of those who exercised regularly, or were current cigarette smokers. However, more CHD survivors (57.5%) than non-CHD workers (33.1%) were ex-smokers p < 0.001, who had stopped smoking at a higher mean (se) age (41.1 (1.36) vs 37.6 (0.20) years respectively; p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of CHD survivors were dyslipidaemic, despite consuming a lower fat, higher fibre and carbohydrate diet. More than 50% of CHD survivors were ex-cigarette smokers, who had given up smoking at a later age than non-CHD workers. These high-risk CHD survivors would benefit from more aggressive measures aimed at correcting their dyslipidaemias.",1999,Jun,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,9,3,125-32,,,10464785,#11503,Metcalf 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

"Low-fat, monounsaturate-rich diets reduce susceptibility of low density lipoproteins to peroxidation ex vivo.",O'Bryne DJ; O'Keefe SF; Shireman RB,"Oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) plays an important role in the process of atherosclerosis. The susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and the amount of peroxidation products formed are influenced by the lipoprotein content of 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, and the 18:2n-6/18:1n-9 ratio, which is dependent in part on dietary fatty acids. The purpose of this study was to determine if changing from a typical American diet to a low-fat, monounsaturate-rich diet (LFMR) would result in favorable alterations in the fatty acid composition and oxidative profile of LDL in hypercholesterolemic individuals. Free-living postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women who routinely consumed a diet moderately high in total fat and total saturates (34 and 11%, respectively) followed an LFMR diet (26% fat, 6% saturated fat, and 14% monounsaturated fat) for 6 mon. Sixteen postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women already following standard low-fat (LF) diets acted as a control for seasonal variations in serum lipids. LDL from randomly selected subjects (LF n = 6, LFMR n = 5) was evaluated. LFMR diets resulted in LDL with increased concentrations and percentages of 18:1n-9, reduced 18:2n-6/18:1n-9 ratio, and lower percentages of 18:2n-6. No significant changes in LDL fatty acids occurred in the LF group. Conjugated diene lag time increased in both groups during copper-induced in vitro oxidation. Only the LFMR group experienced an increase in lipid peroxide lag time and a decrease in lipid peroxide formation.

Dietary fat intake and the risk of coronary heart disease in women.,Hu FB; Stampfer MJ; Manson JE; Rimm E; Colditz GA; Rosner BA; Hennekens CH; Willett WC,"BACKGROUND: The relation between dietary intake of specific types of fat, particularly trans unsaturated fat and the risk of coronary disease remains unclear. We therefore studied this relation in women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. METHODS: We prospectively studied 80,082 women who were 34 to 59 years of age and had no known coronary disease, stroke, cancer, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes in 1980. Information on diet was obtained at base line and updated during follow-up by means of validated questionnaires. During 14 years of follow-up, we documented 939 cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease. Mutivariate analyses included age, smoking status, total energy intake, dietary cholesterol intake, percentages of energy obtained from protein and specific types of fat, and other risk factors. RESULTS: Each increase of 5 percent of energy intake from saturated fat, as compared with equivalent energy intake from carbohydrates, was associated with a 17 percent increase in the risk of coronary disease (relative risk, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.41; P=0.10). As compared with equivalent energy from carbohydrates, the relative risk for a 2 percent increment in energy intake from trans unsaturated fat was 1.93 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.43 to 2.61; P<0.001); that for a 5 percent increment in energy from monounsaturated fat was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.00; P=0.05); and that for a 5 percent increment in energy from polyunsaturated fat was 0.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.85; P= 0.003). Total fat intake was not signficantly related to the risk of coronary disease (for a 5 percent increase in energy from fat, the relative risk was 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.07; P=0.55). We estimated that the replacement of 5 percent of energy from saturated fat with energy from unsaturated fats would reduce risk by 42 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23 to 56; P<0.001) and that the replacement of 2 percent of energy from trans fat with energy from unhydrogenated, unsaturated fats would reduce risk by 53 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 34 to 67; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that replacing saturated and trans unsaturated fats with unhydrogenated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is more effective in preventing coronary heart disease in women than reducing overall fat intake.",1997,Nov,N Engl J Med,337,21,1491-9,,10.1056/NEJM199711203372102,9366580,#11512,Hu 1997,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Weight-loss with low or high carbohydrate diet?,Golay A; Eigenheer C; Morel Y; Kujawski P; Lehmann T; de Tonnac N,"OBJECTIVE: With obesity being recognized as an important cardiovascular risk factor, it is important to determine the optimal hypocaloric diet for decreasing that risk. The goal of this study was to compare the effects of two hypocaloric diets of similar caloric value, but differing in carbohydrate content (25% and 45%). SUBJECTS: Sixty-eight out-patients were followed for 12 w. DESIGN: The patients were assigned to one of two groups that received either a low (25% CHO, n = 31) or a high (45% CHO, n = 37) carbohydrate hypocaloric diet (5.0 MJ/d, 1200 Kcal/d). RESULTS: After 12 w, the mean weight loss was similar and did not differ significantly between the two groups: 10.2 +/- 0.7 kg (25% CHO) and 8.6 +/- 0.8 kg (45% CHO). Furthermore, loss of adipose tissue was similar, 8.1 +/- 0.5 kg (25% CHO) and 7.1 +/- 0.7 kg (45% CHO). Despite a high protein intake (1.4 g/kg/ideal body weight) there was loss of lean body mass: 2.2 +/- 0.4 kg (25% CHO) and 1.4 +/- 0.3 kg (45% CHO). The waist/hip ratio diminished significantly (P < 0.001) and identically in both groups. The fasting blood glucose (even though normal, along with cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, were significantly decreased after weight loss. The fasting blood insulin which was mildly elevated before weight loss decreased more markedly with the 25% CHO diet compared to the 45% CHO diet (P < 0.003). The glucose/insulin ratio improved significantly (P < 0.05) after weight loss with both diets (0.17 +/- 0.04 mmol/mU (25% CHO) vs 0.10 +/- 0.03 mmol/mU (45% CHO). CONCLUSIONS: Neither diet offered a significant advantage when comparing weight loss or other, metabolic parameters over a 12 w period. However, considering the greater improvement of fasting blood insulin, the glucose/insulin ratio and blood triglyceride, the low carbohydrate diet (25%) could be more favourable in the long-term. The improvement of fasting blood insulin could be explained by the differences in monounsaturated fat composition in the low carbohydrate diet.",1996,Dec,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,20,12,1067-72,,,8968851,#11517,Golay 1996,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Dietary composition, body weight, and NIDDM. Comparison of high-fiber, high-carbohydrate, and modified-fat diets.",Walker KZ; O'Dea K; Nicholson GC; Muir JG,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a high-carbohydrate low-fat (HCLF) and a modified-fat (MF) diet on body weight and metabolic control in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) living at home. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four NIDDM patients followed HCLF and MF diets alternately and in random order for a 3-month period while at home, with a 1-month baseline and washout between diets. Before and after each diet, fasting glucose and lipids, HbA1c, blood pressure, and body weight were measured. Dietary preferences were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: Subjects consumed 50% of energy as carbohydrate and 23% as fat on the HCLF diet and 40% of energy as carbohydrate and 36% as fat (over half of which was monounsaturated fat) on the MF diet. Subjects lost weight on both HCLF and MF diets (mean loss 0.7 and 1.3 kg, respectively). Although the MF diet resulted in a small decrease in fasting glucose levels, there was no significant change in HbA1c. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the diets in changes in blood pressure or fasting blood lipids. Most subjects (65%) preferred the MF diet. CONCLUSIONS: Although the MF diet is not a low-fat diet, it did not appear to facilitate weight gain in subjects with NIDDM living at home.

"A proinflammatory diet is associated with inflammatory gene expression among healthy, non-obese adults: Can social ties protect against the risks?",Padin AC; Hébert JR; Woody A; Wilson SJ; Shivappa N; Belury MA; Malarkey WB; Sheridan JF; Kiecolt-Glaser JK,"The Western diet, characterized by high intake of saturated fat, sugar, and salt, is associated with elevated inflammation and chronic disease risk. Few studies have investigated molecular mechanisms linking diet and inflammation; however, a small number of randomized controlled trials suggest that consuming an anti-inflammatory diet (i.e., a primarily plant-based diet rich in monounsaturated fat and lean protein) decreases proinflammatory gene expression. The current study investigated the association between everyday diet and proinflammatory gene expression, as well as the extent to which central adiposity and social involvement modulate risk. Participants were healthy middle-aged and older adults (N = 105) who completed a food frequency questionnaire and reported how many close social roles they have. Anthropometric measurements and blood samples also were collected; gene expression data were analyzed from LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The inflammatory potential of each participant's diet was calculated using the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®). Participants with higher DII® scores, indicating a more proinflammatory diet, had greater IL-6 (b = -0.02, SE = 0.008, p = .01), IL-1β (b = -0.01, SE = 0.006, p = .03), and TNF-α (b = -0.01, SE = 0.005, p = .04) gene expression if they had a smaller sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD); effects were not seen among those with higher SADs. Social involvement served a protective role, such that participants with smaller SADs had greater IL-6 (b = 0.01, SE = 0.004, p = .049) and IL-1β (b = 0.01, SE = 0.003, p = .045) gene expression only if they had less social involvement; there was no effect of diet on gene expression among those who reported greater social participation. Results are the first to demonstrate a link between self-reported diet and proinflammatory gene expression.

Prospective Cohort of Pre- and Post-Diagnosis Diet with Survival Outcomes: an Alberta Endometrial Cancer Cohort Study.,Kokts-Porietis RL; Morielli AR; McNeil J; Courneya KS; Cook LS; Friedenreich CM,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic relationship between diet and endometrial cancer survival remains largely unknown. We sought to determine pre- and post-diagnosis dietary composition, glycemic load (GL), inflammatory potential (dietary inflammatory index) and quality [Canadian Healthy Eating Index (C-HEI) 2005] associations with disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) among endometrial cancer survivors. In addition, we assessed associations between dietary changes with OS and explored obesity/physical activity effect modification. METHODS: Survivors, diagnosed in Alberta, Canada between 2002 and 2006, completed past-year, food-frequency questionnaires at-diagnosis (n = 503) and 3-year follow-up (n = 395). Participants were followed to death or January 2022. Cox proportional regression estimated HR [95% confidence intervals (CI)] for dietary survival associations. RESULTS: During 16.9 median years of follow-up, 138 participants had a DFS event and 120 died. Lower pre-diagnosis GL (HRT1vsT3, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.97) and greater post-diagnosis energy intakes (EI) from total- and monounsaturated-fat (HRT3vsT1, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26-0.87) were associated with better OS. Higher pre-diagnosis C-HEI, less inflammatory diets and lower added sugar intakes were nonlinearly associated with better DFS. Consistently low pre- to post-diagnosis EI from carbohydrates and total-fats were associated with better (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18-0.72) and worse (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.21-4.20) OS, respectively. Decreased pre- to post-diagnosis C-HEI was associated with worse OS. In stratified analysis, healthy diets were most beneficial for survivors with obesity and physical inactivity.

A Randomized Trial with Two Hypocaloric Diets with Different Lipid Profiles and Effects on Serum Omentin-1 Levels in Obese Subjects.,de Luis D; Izaola O; Primo D; Aller R,"BACKGROUND: The effects of weight loss therapies on omentin-1 levels have been unclear, showing both elevations and decreases in circulating levels. The role of dietary fat might have an important role. The aim of our investigation was to evaluate the influence of weight decrease on omentin-1 levels after two different high-fat hypocaloric diets. METHODS: 319 Caucasian obese subjects were randomly allocated during 12 weeks (Diet M (high monounsaturated fat diet) vs. Diet P (high polyunsaturated fat diet)). The mean age was 47.2 ± 5.0 years (range: 26-64), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 37.9 ± 4.1 kg/m(2) (range: 30.6-39.8). Sex distribution was 237 females (74.7%) and 72 males (25.3%). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were evaluated at basal and after both diets. SPSS 23.0 has been used to realize univariant and multivariant statistical analysis. RESULTS: After both diets, BMI, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood, LDL-cholesterol, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR decreased in a statistical way from basal values. These improvements were similar in both diets. After Diet P, omentin-1 levels increase (21.2 ± 9.1 ng/ml: P = 0.02), and after Diet M, this adipokine increases (47.1 ± 11.2 ng/ml: P = 0.02), too. The increase of omentin-1 with Diet M was statistically significantly higher than that after Diet P (P = 0.01). A multiple regression analyses adjusted by age and sex reported a statistical relation between BMI (kg/m(2)) and insulin (UI/L) with omentin-1 levels.

An urgent need for potential therapy to prevent and control NCDs is critical. We hypothesized that higher intakes of multiple individual nutrients, fruits, or vegetables would be linked with a low risk of NCDs in the Korean population. Thus, we aim to explore the association between NCDs, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), arthritis, depression, and dietary factors. A total of 56,462 adults aged 18 years (2009-2019) were included. Dietary factors, including intakes of multiple individual nutrients, fruits, and vegetables, were assessed. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between dietary factors and NCDs. Interactions were found between intakes of multiple individual nutrients and sex for T2DM, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Only in women was a 2-fold increase in daily multiple individual nutrient intake (vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, C; potassium, protein; phosphorus; calcium; iron; monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid; n-3 fatty acid and n-6 fatty acid; and water) associated with a lower prevalence of T2DM, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, arthritis, and osteoarthritis. In both women and men, high fruit or vegetable consumption was linked with a lower risk of T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and depression than low consumption.

"Higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, and multiple individual nutrients is associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome among adults with comorbidities.",Nguyen HD; Oh H; Kim MS,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has attracted increasing attention because its prevalence and socioeconomic burden have increased globally. We hypothesized that higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, and multiple individual nutrients are associated with a lower risk of MetS among adults with comorbidities. Therefore, we aim to explore the association between intake of multiple individual nutrients, vegetables and fruits, and MetS among Korean adults. A data set of 67,302 adults aged ≥ 18 years was collected between 2009 and 2019. Odds ratios for MetS were calculated for log(2)-transformed multiple individual nutrient intake values and for the interaction of sex and comorbidities with multiple individual nutrient intake. Subsequently, we also predict the risks of MetS based on marginal effects. A 2-fold increase in daily vitamin B(2), B(3), total vitamin A, retinol, monounsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, protein, n-3, and n-6 fatty acid intakes was negatively related to the prevalence of MetS in women. High white and red vegetable consumption was associated with a lower risk of MetS in both women and men, whereas high fruit consumption was associated with a lower risk of MetS in men. Furthermore, increased daily vitamin B(2), retinol intake, high fruit, and white and red vegetable consumption reduce the risk of MetS among adults with comorbidities. These findings reveal a link between nutrients, fruits, vegetables, and the presence of MetS.

No studies have evaluated the relation of the Dietary Portfolio with incident CVD events. Methods and Results We followed 123 330 postmenopausal women initially free of CVD in the Women's Health Initiative from 1993 through 2017. We used Cox proportional-hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI of the association of adherence to a Portfolio Diet score with CVD outcomes. Primary outcomes were total CVD, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Secondary outcomes were heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Over a mean follow-up of 15.3 years, 13 365 total CVD, 5640 coronary heart disease, 4440 strokes, 1907 heart failure, and 929 atrial fibrillation events occurred. After multiple adjustments, adherence to the Portfolio Diet score was associated with lower risk of total CVD (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.94), coronary heart disease (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.95), and heart failure (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.99), comparing the highest to lowest quartile of adherence.

A Cross-Sectional Comparison of the Whole Blood Fatty Acid Profile and Omega-3 Index of Male Vegan and Omnivorous Endurance Athletes.,Craddock JC; Probst YC; Neale EP; Peoples GE,"Background: Evaluation of the dietary fat consumption in athletes following vegan diets is scarce. The aim of this study was to explore the intakes, availability, and uptake of physiologically relevant fatty acids into whole blood, and consequently the Omega-3 Index (O3I) of endurance athletes following vegan and omnivorous dietary patterns.Materials: Males aged 18 to 55 years, engaging in ≥ four hours of training/week and following a vegan (>6 months) or omnivorous dietary pattern were eligible to participate. A 7-day food and training diary was collected and an incremental ramp running protocol used to determine peak aerobic capacity. A finger prick blood sample was collected to determine the whole blood fatty acid profile and O3I. Participants were grouped as following a vegan or omnivorous diet matched for age, training volume and peak aerobic capacity.Results: The vegan group (n = 12) consumed significantly less dietary total fat (122.2 g/day vs 84.1 g/day p = 0.007), saturated fat (43.74 g/day vs 18.42 g/day p < 0.0001), monounsaturated fat (49.6 g/day vs 35.64 g/day p = 0.039) and long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) compared to the omnivorous group (n = 8).

Effects of Replacing Dietary Monounsaturated Fat With Carbohydrate on HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) Protein Metabolism and Proteome Composition in Humans.,Andraski AB; Singh SA; Lee LH; Higashi H; Smith N; Zhang B; Aikawa M; Sacks FM,"OBJECTIVE: Clinical evidence has linked low HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels with high cardiovascular disease risk; however, its significance as a therapeutic target remains unestablished. We hypothesize that HDLs functional heterogeneity is comprised of metabolically distinct proteins, each on distinct HDL sizes and that are affected by diet. Approach and Results: Twelve participants were placed on 2 healthful diets high in monounsaturated fat or carbohydrate. After 4 weeks on each diet, participants completed a metabolic tracer study. HDL was isolated by Apo (apolipoprotein) A1 immunopurification and separated into 5 sizes. Tracer enrichment and metabolic rates for 8 HDL proteins-ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC3, ApoE, ApoJ, ApoL1, ApoM, and LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase)-were determined by parallel reaction monitoring and compartmental modeling, respectively. Each protein had a unique, size-specific distribution that was not altered by diet. However, carbohydrate, when replacing fat, increased the fractional catabolic rate of ApoA1 and ApoA2 on alpha3 HDL; ApoE on alpha3 and alpha1 HDL; and ApoM on alpha2 HDL. Additionally, carbohydrate increased the production of ApoC3 on alpha3 HDL and ApoJ and ApoL1 on the largest alpha0 HDL. LCAT was the only protein studied that diet did not affect. Finally, global proteomics showed that diet did not alter the distribution of the HDL proteome across HDL sizes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that HDL in humans is composed of a complex system of proteins, each with its own unique size distribution, metabolism, and diet regulation. The carbohydrate-induced hypercatabolic state of HDL proteins may represent mechanisms by which carbohydrate alters the cardioprotective properties of HDL.",2019,Nov,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,39,11,2411-2430,,10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312889,31554421,#11556,Andraski 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
The Association Between Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ) and Glioma and Evaluation of Nutrient Intakes of These Patients: A Case-Control Study.,Shayanfar M; Vahid F; Faghfoori Z; Davoodi SH; Goodarzi R,"INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common adult brain tumors. Dietary factors may play a role in the etiology of glioma. The Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ) provides a general overview for the nutrient content of a food or a diet. This study aimed to investigate the association between INQ and glioma and nutrient intakes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was included 128 patients and 256 controls. Dietary intakes of the subjects were evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and FFQ-derived dietary data were used to calculate INQ scores. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Cases had higher intake of total fat, saturated fatty acid (SFA), meats, hydrogenated oils and controls had higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, calcium, dairy, fruits, and nuts. Only the INQ of vitamin C, vitamin E, calcium, and fiber are higher in controls. An inverse association was observed between glioma and INQ of calcium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and fiber. CONCLUSION: The results of this study propose a healthy diet such as high intake of vitamins C and E, calcium, fiber, food groups like fruits and vegetables, and low-fat milk and nuts; and low consumption of total fat, SFA, and red meat may be protective against glioma.",2018,Feb-Mar,Nutr Cancer,70,2,213-220,,10.1080/01635581.2018.1412469,29236551,#11568,Shayanfar 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Feasibility and acceptability of a Mediterranean-style diet intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk for low income Hispanic American women.,Estrada Del Campo Y; Cubillos L; Vu MB; Aguirre A; Reuland DS; Keyserling TC,"OBJECTIVE: Evidence for the cardioprotective effects of a Mediterranean-style (Med-style) diet is strong, however few Med-style dietary interventions have been developed for and tested among Hispanic Americans (HAs), especially younger HAs of reproductive age whose dietary habits may strongly influence dietary intake for all family members. DESIGN: We adapted a previously tested and evidence-informed lifestyle intervention to reduce CVD risk and evaluated its feasibility, acceptability, and effects on self-reported lifestyle behaviors in this study enrolling low-income HA women attending a Title X family planning clinic in eastern North Carolina. The 3-month long intervention, given to all participants, promoted a Med-style dietary pattern with a focus on increasing consumption of foods commonly consumed by HA that have high quality dietary fats (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats primarily from plant sources and fish) and carbohydrates (fruits, vegetables, and whole grains). The intervention also recommended increasing physical activity and was given during 2 face-to-face counseling sessions and 2 telephone counseling sessions. Major outcomes were engagement with study activities and intervention acceptability; lifestyle behavior change at 3-month follow-up is also reported. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics (n = 36) were: mean age 33 years, 35 (97%) without health insurance, 32 (89%) born in Mexico, and mean BMI 30 kg/m(2). Engagement was high among the 36 participants with 33 (92%) completing the intervention and follow-up measures. At follow-up, most participants thought the intervention was helpful (range: 85-100%) and acceptable (100% agreed 'I would recommend the program to others'). The mean dietary fat quality score improved by 0.5 units (95% CI: 0.0-1.1) and the mean fruit-vegetable servings/day improved by 0.7/day (95% CI: 0.1-1.3). CONCLUSION: Intervention engagement and acceptability were high and there was improvement in self-reported dietary behaviors. This type of Med-style dietary pattern intervention should be evaluated in randomized trials enrolling HAs at risk for CVD.",2019,May,Ethn Health,24,4,415-431,,10.1080/13557858.2017.1346784,28670906,#11572,EstradaDelCampo 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of Changing the Amount and Source of Dietary Carbohydrates on Symptoms and Dietary Satisfaction Over a 1-Year Period in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes: Canadian Trial of Carbohydrates in Diabetes (CCD).,Wolever TM; Chiasson JL; Josse RG; Leiter LA; Maheux P; Rabasa-Lhoret R; Rodger NW; Ryan EA,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term effects of changing the amount or source of dietary carbohydrate on quality of life (QOL), symptoms and dietary satisfaction in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Subjects with diabetes treated by diet alone (n=162) were randomly assigned to high-carbohydrate/high-glycemic-index (HGI) diets; high-carbohydrate/low-glycemic-index (LGI) diets; or lower-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated-fat (LC) diets for 1 year. We measured QOL at baseline and at study's end, and we measured symptoms and dietary satisfaction quarterly. RESULTS: The HGI, LGI and LC diets contained, respectively, 47±1, 52±1 and 40±1% energy carbohydrate; 30±1, 27±1 and 40±1% fat with GI 64±0.4, 55±0.4 and 59±0.4. Significantly more participants reported increased flatulence on LGI than on LC and HGI diets at 3 months (41%, 19%, 14%; p<0.05), but not at 12 months (29%, 17%, 17%; ns). Abdominal distension was more severe (46% vs. 14%, 19%; p<0.05), and headache less severe (8% vs. 22%, 23%; p<0.05) on LGI than on both other diets. Increased appetite was more severe on LC (33%) than on HGI diets (14%, p<0.05). Joint/limb pains were less severe on LGI (16%) than HGI (28%) diets. LC elicited more severe gloomy thoughts (23%) than LGI (4%; p<0.05) but greater dietary-satisfaction (70%; p<0.05) than LGI (40%) and HGI (48%) diets. For all diets, glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels increased less in those who gained less weight, had less increased appetite and were more satisfied with the enjoyment obtained from eating. CONCLUSIONS: Each diet elicited increased severity of 1 or more symptoms than the other diets. Although overall dietary satisfaction was greater on the 40% carbohydrate diet than on the 50% carbohydrate diet, the LGI diet was no less satisfying than the HGI diet.

"High cholesterol dietary intake during pregnancy is associated with large for gestational age in a sample of low-income women of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",de Castro MBT; Farias DR; Lepsch J; Mendes RH; Ferreira AA; Kac G,"The association between the quality of maternal dietary fat intake during pregnancy and the infant's birthweight (BW) remains controversial. Our goal was to investigate the association between maternal dietary fat intake during pregnancy and the rate of large for gestational age (LGA) newborns. This study employed a cross-sectional analysis of 297 pairs of mothers/children attending a public maternity at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. BW for gestational age according to the Intergrowth 21st was defined as follows: adequate for gestational age (AGA ≤ 90th percentile) and LGA (>90th percentile). The statistical analysis was a Poisson regression with robust estimations of the standard errors. Maternal dietary fat intake variables comprised lipids (% total energy); saturated (mg/1000 kcal), monounsaturated (mg/1000 kcal) and polyunsaturated (mg/1000 kcal) fats; and cholesterol (mg/1000 kcal), all of which were obtained with a Food Frequency Questionnaire. The mean BW was 3338 g (SD = 446.9), and the rate of LGA newborns was 13.1%. The mean maternal total energy intake was 2880 kcal (SD = 1074), cholesterol was 154.3 mg/1000 kcal (SD = 68.1) and monounsaturated fat was 6.9 mg/1000 kcal (SD = 2). Mothers of LGA newborns reported higher cholesterol dietary intake (195.8 vs. 148 mg/1000 kcal; P < 0.001), pre-pregnancy body mass index (25.1 vs. 23.5 kg/m(2) ; P = 0.026) when compared with mothers of AGA newborns. Women with cholesterol intake within the fourth quartile were 2.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.31-4.66) times more likely to have an LGA infant compared with those in the 1-3 quartiles.

The relationship between BMI and dietary intake of primary school children from a rural area of South Africa: The Ellisras longitudinal study.,Van Den Ende C; Twisk JW; Monyeki KD,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between dietary intake and BMI of primary school children from a rural area of South Africa cross-sectionally. Both under and over nutrition remain major health problems in South Africa. In rural areas, where especially undernutrition leads to child morbidity and mortality, determinants should be detected. METHODS: Data was used from 825 children (421 boys, 404 girls), aged 6-12 years, participating in the Ellisras Longitudinal Growth study. Height and weight were measured in accordance with the protocol of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry. Internationally recommended cut-off points for body mass index (BMI) were used. Dietary intake was measured using the 24 h recall method. In general, boys and girls from Ellisras had dietary intake levels lower than or according to dietary guidelines. RESULTS: A singular linear regression model showed a significant association between monounsaturated fat and BMI. The multiple model demonstrated that total fat (B = 0.05, CI: 0.019-0.082), monounsaturated fat (B = -0.093, CI: -0.160 to -0.026) and polyunsaturated fat (B = 0.056, CI: 0.09-0.02) predict BMI. CONCLUSION: This study supports previous findings about BMI and dietary trends in rural areas of South Africa. Despite low fat intake of the subjects, this macronutrient appeared to predict BMI most strongly. More research is needed; however, to further examine how healthy their lifestyle is nowadays with respect to diet and into what extent the nutrition transition has reached this area.",2014,Sep-Oct,Am J Hum Biol,26,5,701-6,,10.1002/ajhb.22585,25043879,#11582,VanDenEnde 2014,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Relationships between serum and colon concentrations of carotenoids and fatty acids in randomized dietary intervention trial.,Sen A; Ren J; Ruffin MT; Turgeon DK; Brenner DE; Sidahmed E; Rapai ME; Cornellier ML; Djuric Z,"Little is known about the effect of preventive diets on colonic nutrient concentrations. This study randomized 120 persons at increased risk of colon cancer to a Mediterranean versus a Healthy Eating diet for six months. The former targeted increases in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, monounsaturated, and n3 fats. The Healthy Eating diet was based on Healthy People 2010 recommendations. At baseline, dietary fat and carotenoid intakes were poorly associated (Spearman ρ < 0.4) with serum and colon concentrations. Strong associations were observed between serum and colon measurements of β-cryptoxanthin (ρ = 0.58; P < 0.001), α-carotene (ρ = 0.48; P < 0.001), and β-carotene (ρ = 0.45; P < 0.001). After six months, the Healthy Eating intervention increased serum lutein, β-, and α-carotene significantly (P < 0.05). In the Mediterranean arm, the significant increases were in serum lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, β-carotene, monounsaturated, and n3 fats. A significant group-by-time interaction (P = 0.03) was obtained for monounsaturated fats. Colonic increases in carotenoids and n3 fats were significant only in Healthy Eating arm, whereas the group-by-time interaction was significant for β-carotene (P = 0.02) and α-carotene (P = 0.03). Changes in colon concentrations were not significantly associated with reported dietary changes. Changes in colon and serum concentrations were strongly associated for β-cryptoxanthin (ρ = 0.56; P < 0.001) and α-carotene (ρ = 0.40; P < 0.001). The associations between colonic and serum concentrations suggest the potential use of using serum concentration as a target in dietary interventions aimed at reducing colon cancer risk.",2013,Jun,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),6,6,558-65,,10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0019,23592741,#11585,Sen 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Lys656Asn polymorphism of leptin receptor gene is related with leptin changes after a high monounsaturated fat diet in obese patients.,de Luis DA; Aller R; Izaola O; Conde R; Eiros Bouza J,"BACKGROUND: Human obesity is characterized by high levels of leptin, and it has been suggested that obese patients may be leptin resistant. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of Lys656Asn polymorphism in the leptin receptor gene on metabolic response, weight loss, and serum leptin levels to a high monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet in obese patients. DESIGN: A sample of 126 obese patients was analyzed in a prospective way. The hypocaloric diet had 1342 kcal, 46.6% of carbohydrates, 34.1% of lipids, and 19.2% of proteins, with a 67.5% of monounsaturated fats, during 3 months. RESULTS: In Lys656Lys genotype, body mass index (-1.8 ± 1.4 kg/m), weight (-4.3 ± 3.7 kg), fat mass (-3.5 ± 3.5 kg), waist circumference (-5.0 ± 2.9 cm), systolic blood pressure (-3.8 ± 10.5 mm Hg), insulin (-1.5 ± 4.6 mUI/L), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (-0.4 ± 1.9 Units) decreased. In Asn allele carriers, body mass index (1.5 ± 2.1 kg/m), weight (-3.7 ± 3.1 kg), waist circumference (-4.4 ± 3.1 cm) decreased. Only leptin levels have a significant decrease in the Lys656Lys group (-6.9 ± 10.1 ng/mL) (24.2%).

Dietary fat intake and risk of breast cancer: a case-control study in China.,Zhang CX; Ho SC; Lin FY; Chen YM; Cheng SZ; Fu JH,"The association between consumption of fat and specific types of fat and the risk of breast cancer has been examined in previous studies, but the results remain unclear. Moreover, few studies were conducted in China, where dietary habits are different from those of the Western countries. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study from June 2007 to August 2008 among Chinese women residing in Guangdong to investigate the associations of dietary fat and specific types of fat with the risk of breast cancer. Four hundred and thirty-eight consecutively recruited cases with primary breast cancer were frequency matched to 438 controls by age (5-year interval) and residence (rural/urban). Detailed dietary intake information was assessed by face-to-face interviews with a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from multiple unconditional logistic regression models controlling for nondietary and dietary potential confounders. Total fat intake was not associated with the risk of breast cancer after adjustment for various confounding variables (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.50-1.32, Ptrend = 0.739). Intakes of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, n-3 polyunsaturated fat, and n-6 polyunsaturated fat were also not significantly associated with breast cancer risk. However, consumption of polyunsaturated fat was observed to be associated with a significantly lower risk of breast cancer. Compared with the lowest quartile, the adjusted OR in the highest quartile was 0.50 (95% CI = 0.27-0.93, Ptrend = 0.034). This study suggested that intakes of total fat, saturated and monounsaturated fat, n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fat were not associated with risk of breast cancer, but that polyunsaturated fat decreased the risk.",2011,May,Eur J Cancer Prev,20,3,199-206,,10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32834572bb,21403522,#11598,Zhang 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Effects of dietary fat modification on skeletal muscle fatty acid handling in the metabolic syndrome.,van Hees AM; Saris WH; Hul GB; Schaper NC; Timmerman BE; Lovegrove JA; Roche HM; Blaak EE,"OBJECTIVE: In the metabolic syndrome (MetS), increased fat storage in 'nonadipose' tissues such as skeletal muscle may be related to insulin resistance ('lipid overflow' hypothesis). The objective of this study was to examine the effects of dietary fat modification on the capacity of skeletal muscle to handle dietary and endogenous fatty acids (FAs). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In total, 29 men with the MetS were randomly assigned to one of four diets for 12 weeks: a high-fat saturated fat diet (HSFA, n=6), a high-fat monounsaturated fat diet (HMUFA, n=7) and two low-fat high-complex carbohydrate diets supplemented with (LFHCCn-3, n=8) or without (LFHCC, n=8) 1.24 g per day docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid. Fasting and postprandial skeletal muscle FA handling was examined by measuring arteriovenous concentration differences across the forearm muscle. [(2)H(2)]-palmitate was infused intravenously to label endogenous triacylglycerol (TAG) and free fatty acids in the circulation and subjects received a high-fat mixed meal (2.6 MJ, 61 energy% fat) containing [U-(13)C]-palmitate to label chylomicron-TAG. RESULTS: Postprandial circulating TAG concentrations were significantly lower after dietary intervention in the LFHCCn-3 group compared to the HSFA group (DeltaiAUC -139+/-67 vs 167+/-70 micromol l(-1) min(-1), P=0.009), together with decreased concentrations of [U-(13)C]-labeled TAG, representing dietary FA. Fasting TAG clearance across forearm muscle was decreased on the HSFA diet, whereas no differences were observed in postprandial forearm muscle FA handling between diets. CONCLUSION: Chronic manipulation of dietary fat quantity and quality did not affect forearm muscle FA handling in men with the MetS.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the association between the amount and type of dietary fat and subsequent weight change (follow-up weight minus baseline weight divided by duration of follow-up). DESIGN: We analyzed data from 89,432 men and women from 6 cohorts of the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study. Using country-specific food-frequency questionnaires, we examined the association between baseline fat intake (amount and type of total, saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fats) and annual weight change by using the residual, nutrient density, and energy-partition methods. We used random-effects meta-analyses to obtain pooled estimates across centers. RESULTS: Mean total fat intake as a percentage of energy intake ranged between 31.5% and 36.5% across the 6 cohorts (58% women; mean +/- SD age: 53.2 +/- 8.6 y). The mean (+/-SD) annual weight change was 109 +/- 817 g/y in men and 119 +/- 823 g/y in women. In pooled analyses adjusted for anthropometric, dietary, and lifestyle factors and follow-up period, no significant association was observed between fat intake (amount or type) and weight change.

"Nutritional factors in relation to endometrial cancer: a report from a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China.",Xu WH; Dai Q; Xiang YB; Zhao GM; Ruan ZX; Cheng JR; Zheng W; Shu XO,"We evaluated the role of dietary nutrients in the etiology of endometrial cancer in a population-based case-control study of 1,204 newly diagnosed endometrial cancer cases and 1,212 age frequency-matched controls. Information on usual dietary habits was collected during an in-person interview using a validated, quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of nutrients with endometrial cancer risk using an energy density method (e.g., nutrient intake/1,000 kilocalories of intake). Higher energy intake was associated with increased risk, which was attributable to animal source energy and a high proportion of energy from protein and fat. Odds ratios comparing highest versus lowest quintiles of intake were elevated for intake of animal protein (Odds ratio (OR) = 2.0, 95% confidential interval: 1.5-2.7) and fat (OR = 1.5, 1.2-2.0), but reduced for plant sources of these nutrients (OR = 0.7, 0.5-0.9 for protein and OR = 0.6, 0.5-0.8 for fat). Further analysis showed that saturated and monounsaturated fat intake was associated with elevated risk, while polyunsaturated fat intake was unrelated to risk. Dietary retinol, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, fiber, and vitamin supplements were inversely associated with risk. No significant association was observed for dietary vitamin B1 or vitamin B2. Our findings suggest that associations of dietary macronutrients with endometrial cancer risk may depend on their sources, with intake of animal origin nutrients being related to higher risk and intake of plant origin nutrients related to lower risk. Dietary fiber, retinol, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin supplementation may decrease the risk of endometrial cancer.",2007,Apr,Int J Cancer,120,8,1776-81,,10.1002/ijc.22456,17230528,#11618,Xu 2007,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Fat intake is associated with serum estrogen and androgen concentrations in postmenopausal Japanese women.,Nagata C; Nagao Y; Shibuya C; Kashiki Y; Shimizu H,"A reduction in fat intake has been associated with decreased estrogen levels in dietary intervention studies. However, previous cross-sectional studies conducted mainly among Western populations did not find a positive association between fat intake and postmenopausal estrogen levels. This study examined the cross-sectional association of fat intake with serum levels of estrone, estradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) in women. Study subjects were 324 healthy postmenopausal Japanese women. Diet including fat intake was assessed by a validated semiquantitative FFQ. After controlling for age and other potential breast cancer risk factors, serum estrone was positively associated with the percentage of energy from total fat (P = 0.04).

Serum DHEAS was positively associated with the percentage of energy from total fat (P = 0.007), saturated fat (P = 0.009), monounsaturated fat (P = 0.006), and polyunsaturated fat (P = 0.04). Serum estrone and DHEAS concentrations increased 11.8 and 9.3%, respectively, with a 5% increase in the percentage of energy from total fat.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic at Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Norway. PATIENTS: Forty renal transplant patients, 20 patients (14 men and 6 women) in both groups. There were 4 diabetic patients in each group. METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed by 4-day dietary records. Health-related quality of life was investigated by the SF-36 questionnaire. The main outcome variables were daily energy intake and intakes of protein, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, and fruit and vegetables. The variables were tested by 2-sample t-tests, and significance was set at.05. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in daily energy intake between the groups (P =.08), but there were significantly higher daily intakes of protein (P =.003), total fat (P =.03), monounsaturated fat (P =.02), cholesterol (P =.04), fiber (P =.02), calcium (P =.03), and fruit and vegetables (P =.03) in the group living at the patient hotel.

Premenopausal fat intake and risk of breast cancer.,Cho E; Spiegelman D; Hunter DJ; Chen WY; Stampfer MJ; Colditz GA; Willett WC,"BACKGROUND: International comparisons and case-control studies have suggested a positive relation between dietary fat intake and breast cancer risk, but prospective studies, most of them involving postmenopausal women, have not supported this association. We conducted a prospective analysis of the relation between dietary fat intake and breast cancer risk among premenopausal women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study II. METHODS: Dietary fat intake and breast cancer risk were assessed among 90 655 premenopausal women aged 26 to 46 years in 1991. Fat intake was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline in 1991 and again in 1995. Breast cancers were self-reported and confirmed by review of pathology reports. Multivariable relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: During 8 years of follow-up, 714 women developed incident invasive breast cancer. Relative to women in the lowest quintile of fat intake, women in the highest quintile of intake had a slight increased risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.59; P(trend) =.06). The increase was associated with intake of animal fat but not vegetable fat; RRs for the increasing quintiles of animal fat intake were 1.00 (referent), 1.28, 1.37, 1.54, and 1.33 (95% CI = 1.02 to 1.73; P(trend) =.002). Intakes of both saturated and monounsaturated fat were related to modestly elevated breast cancer risk. Among food groups contributing to animal fat, red meat and high-fat dairy foods were each associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of animal fat, mainly from red meat and high-fat dairy foods, during premenopausal years is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.",2003,Jul,J Natl Cancer Inst,95,14,1079-85,,10.1093/jnci/95.14.1079,12865454,#11639,Cho 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary fats and the risk of incident Alzheimer disease.,Morris MC; Evans DA; Bienias JL; Tangney CC; Bennett DA; Aggarwal N; Schneider J; Wilson RS,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the effects of dietary fats on the development of Alzheimer disease. We examined the associations between intake of specific types of fat and incident Alzheimer disease in a biracial community study. METHODS: We performed clinical evaluations on a stratified random sample of 815 community residents aged 65 years and older who were unaffected by Alzheimer disease at baseline and who completed a food-frequency questionnaire a mean of 2.3 years before clinical evaluation. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, 131 persons developed Alzheimer disease. Intakes of saturated fat and trans-unsaturated fat were positively associated with risk of Alzheimer disease, whereas intakes of omega-6 polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat were inversely associated. Persons in the upper fifth of saturated-fat intake had 2.2 times the risk of incident Alzheimer disease compared with persons in the lowest fifth in a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, race, education, and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele status (95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.7). Risk also increased with consumption of trans-unsaturated fats, beginning with the second fifth of intake (relative risk, 2.4 compared with the lowest fifth; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.3). We observed linear inverse associations between Alzheimer disease and vegetable fat (P =.002), and, after further adjustment for other types of fat, marginally significant associations with intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fat (P =.10 for trend) and monounsaturated fat (P =.10 for trend). Intakes of total fat, animal fat, and dietary cholesterol were not associated with Alzheimer disease. CONCLUSION: High intake of unsaturated, unhydrogenated fats may be protective against Alzheimer disease, whereas intake of saturated or trans-unsaturated (hydrogenated) fats may increase risk.",2003,Feb,Arch Neurol,60,2,194-200,,10.1001/archneur.60.2.194,12580703,#11642,Morris 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Human skin condition and its associations with nutrient concentrations in serum and diet.,Boelsma E; van de Vijver LP; Goldbohm RA; Klöpping-Ketelaars IA; Hendriks HF; Roza L,"BACKGROUND: Nutritional factors exert promising actions on the skin, but only scant information is available on the modulating effects of physiologic concentrations of nutrients on the skin condition of humans. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate whether nutrient concentrations in serum and diet are associated with the skin condition of humans. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which data on serum concentrations of nutrients, dietary intake of nutrients, and the hydration, sebum content, and surface pH of skin were obtained from 302 healthy men and women. Skin condition was measured with the use of noninvasive techniques. Dietary intake was assessed with 2 complementary food-frequency questionnaires. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate associations of serum vitamins and carotenoids and of dietary micro- and macronutrients with skin condition. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, including sex, age, and smoking, statistically significant associations were shown in the total population between serum vitamin A and skin sebum content and surface pH and between the dietary intake of total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and skin hydration. Monounsaturated fat intake was also associated with surface pH. Associations between serum beta-cryptoxanthin and skin hydration and between surface pH and fluid and calcium intakes were observed in men only. CONCLUSION: Several associations between nutrients in serum and diet and skin condition were observed, indicating that changes in baseline nutritional status may affect skin condition.",2003,Feb,Am J Clin Nutr,77,2,348-55,,10.1093/ajcn/77.2.348,12540393,#11643,Boelsma 2003,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Cardiovascular risk reduction and dietary compliance with a home-delivered diet and lifestyle modification program.,Gleason JA; Bourdet KL; Koehn K; Holay SY; Schaefer EJ,"Lack of adherence to diet contributes to ineffective dietary responsiveness and elevated cardiovascular risk factors in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Our purpose was to determine if home-delivered, heart-healthy meals and snacks, combined with telephone diet education, would be efficacious in improving dietary compliance, quality of life, and cardiovascular risk factors (primarily low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol and body weight) in CHD patients. Participants were 35 free-living subjects (21 men, 14 postmenopausal women) with a mean age of 62 (ranging from 40 to 79 years) in an 8-week diet intervention. A registered dietitian provided diet education over the telephone and weekly menus averaging 67% carbohydrate, 16% protein, 17% fat, 4% saturated fat, 5% monounsaturated fat, 128 mg cholesterol, and 25 g fiber. Lipid profiles, anthropometric measures, food records, and quality of diet, and life questionnaires were obtained at baseline, week 4, and week 8. Mean compliance-defined as percentage of prepared food energy consumed divided by percentage of prepared food energy provided-was 91% at 4 weeks and 88% at 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, significant reductions in weight (-3.7 kg), waist circumference (-2.0 in), hip circumference (-1.3 in), body mass index (-1.21 kg/m2), total cholesterol (-0.17 mmol/dL, -7.0 mg/dL), and LDL cholesterol (-0.19 mmol/dL, -7.5 mg/dL) (P<.05) were achieved without significant changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.00 mmol/dL, 0.0 mg/dL) or triglycerides (+0.06 mmol/dL, +2.5 mg/dL). Significant improvements in quality of life and quality of diet (P < .05) were also demonstrated.

"Dietary intake and changes in lipoprotein lipids in obese, postmenopausal women placed on an American Heart Association Step 1 diet.",Bunyard LB; Dennis KE; Nicklas BJ,"BACKGROUND: Dietary intake and changes in lipoprotein lipids in obese, postmenopausal women placed on an American Heart Association Step 1 diet. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the specific dietary factors associated with the commonly observed decrease in HDL-C concentration in obese, postmenopausal women placed on a low-fat diet. DESIGN/SUBJECTS/INTERVENTION: Dietary intake, lipoprotein lipid concentrations, and body weight were measured before and after 10 weeks of instruction in the principles of the American Heart Association (AHA) Step 1 diet in 55 overweight and obese (body mass index=33+/-4 kg/m2), sedentary, postmenopausal women (mean age 59+/-5 years). RESULTS: The percent of energy obtained from total fat, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol decreased significantly after dietary intervention, while the polyunsaturated:saturated ratio and the percent of energy obtained from total carbohydrate, complex carbohydrate, and simple carbohydrate increased. On average, the women lost a small, but significant, amount of body weight (2%+/-3%, P<.0001). Adherence to the AHA diet reduced total cholesterol (-8%+/-8%), LDL-C (-6%+/-11%), and HDL-C (-16%+/-10%). The only dietary change that predicted decreases in HDL-C concentrations was the increase in the percent of energy from simple sugar (r=-0.32, P<.05). There were no relationships between changes in HDL-C and changes in percent of energy from fat (r=0.16), saturated fat (r=0.07), polyunsaturated fat (r=0.04), or monounsaturated fat (r=0.09). APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women, a dietary reduction in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol reduces body weight, total cholesterol, and LDL-C, but substitution of simple sugar for dietary fat may lead to a reduction in HDL-C. Further research is needed to determine which specific simple sugars are contributing to diet-induced reductions in HDL-C in older women placed on a low-fat diet.",2002,Jan,J Am Diet Assoc,102,1,52-7,,10.1016/s0002-8223(02)90016-7,11794502,#11646,Bunyard 2002,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Group office visits change dietary habits of patients with coronary artery disease-the dietary intervention and evaluation trial (D.I.E.T.).,Masley S; Phillips S; Copeland JR,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effectiveness of a low-cost group visit intervention for changing the dietary intake and lipid levels of patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We performed a controlled random group assignment trial in 4 community outpatient clinics. The Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial randomized 97 patients with CAD to either a control group that followed the National Cholesterol Education Program's Step II-III diet plan (n=48) or an experimental group that received meal plans, recipes, and nutritional information during monthly group office sessions (n=49). Both groups received lipid-lowering medications and were followed-up over 12 months. We assessed dietary intake, fasting lipid profiles, hemoglobin A1C levels, and per member per month (PMPM) expense data. RESULTS: Food frequency data showed that eating fruits and vegetables and cooking with monounsaturated fat increased significantly in the experimental group compared with the control group at 1 year (P=.0072; P=.0001; P=.0004). The total PMPM expenses decreased for both groups (38% for the experimental group and 10% for the control group), but the cost difference was statistically nonsignificant (P=.2975). Both groups noted low-density lipoprotein reductions, significant only in the experimental group (P=.0035). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that using group office visits for patients with CAD was an effective method for helping subjects make dietary changes and for improving lipid levels. Patients with known CAD and elevated lipid levels were willing to make significant lifestyle changes when offered a program that emphasizes healthy foods in a group visit format.",2001,Mar,J Fam Pract,50,3,235-9,,,11252212,#11653,Masley 2001,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Diet as a risk factor for the development of ulcerative colitis.,Geerling BJ; Dagnelie PC; Badart-Smook A; Russel MG; Stockbrügger RW; Brummer RJ,"OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been considered as a possible risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, available data are inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the etiological role of dietary factors in the development of UC. METHODS: Recently diagnosed (<6 Months) UC patients (n = 43) and age- and gender-matched population controls (n = 43) were studied in a case-control design. The crosscheck dietary history method was used to assess dietary intake of 5 yr before the study. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition was used as a biomarker of long-term fat intake. Conditional logistic regression-derived odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for statistical analysis. Dietary intake ORs were adjusted for energy intake. RESULTS: High intakes of monounsaturated fat (OR: 33.9 [95% CI 2.6-443.1]), polyunsaturated fat (OR: 5.1 [95% CI 1.0-26.7]), and vitamin B6 (OR: 6.9 [95% CI 1.6-30.7]) were associated with an increased risk to develop UC. No other significant associations were found with UC risk. CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of mono- and polyunsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing UC.

Association between dietary fat and breast cancer in Puerto Rican postmenopausal women attending a breast cancer clinic.,Santiago E; González MJ; Matos MI; Pérez CM,"OBJECTIVE: A pilot case-control study was conducted to examine the possible association between dietary fat intake and the development of postmenopausal breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Studies regarding the association between dietary fat intake and the development of breast cancer among postmenopausal women are lacking in Puerto Rico. METHODS: Eighteen cases and eighteen controls were interviewed to obtain sociodemographic information, medical history and dietary fat intake. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire containing 67 food items was used to collect the dietary information. RESULTS: Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) showed a non-significant positive association for total fat intake and the development of postmenopausal breast cancer (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 0.42-5.90, p = 0.25). The same non significant positive association was found for saturated fat intake (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 0.42-5.90, p = 0.25). Polyunsaturated fat (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.34-4.64, p = 0.37) and monounsaturated fat (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.34-4.64, p = 0.37) were also positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer, although the associations were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with other case-control studies that have shown non-significant positive associations between total fat and the different components of dietary fat and postmenopausal breast cancer.",1998,Sep,P R Health Sci J,17,3,235-41,,,9883469,#11664,Santiago 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Mechanisms of increase in plasma triacylglycerol concentrations as a result of high carbohydrate intakes in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,Blades B; Garg A,"To determine the mechanisms of increase in plasma triacylglycerol concentrations after high dietary intakes of carbohydrates, 10 men with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were fed an isoenergetic high-carbohydrate diet (55% of energy as carbohydrate and 30% as fat) and a high-monounsaturated-fat diet (45% of energy as fat and 40% as carbohydrates) for 6 wk in a randomized, crossover manner. The high-carbohydrate diet raised fasting plasma triacylglycerol concentrations by 26% (P = 0.007) but did not affect postheparin lipoprotein lipase (P = 0.2) or hepatic lipase activities (P = 0.9). The oral-fat-tolerance test labeled with retinyl palmitate also revealed no differences in postprandial plasma triacylglycerol (P = 0.37) or retinyl palmitate clearances (P = 0.34) between the two diets. We conclude that the increase in plasma triacylglycerol concentrations with high-carbohydrate diets in men with NIDDM is not due to reduced lipolysis or diminished postprandial clearance of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins but is primarily due to increased hepatic secretion of very-low-density-lipoprotein triacylglycerols.",1995,Nov,Am J Clin Nutr,62,5,996-1002,,10.1093/ajcn/62.5.996,7572748,#11675,Blades 1995,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Long term metabolic effects of two dietary methods of treating hyperlipidaemia.,Rivellese AA; Auletta P; Marotta G; Saldalamacchia G; Giacco A; Mastrilli V; Vaccaro O; Riccardi G,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the long term metabolic effects of two diets for treating hyperlipidaemia. DESIGN: Randomised controlled study: after three weeks of normal (control) diet, subjects were randomly allocated to one of two test diets and followed up for six months. SETTING: Lipid clinic of tertiary referral centre in Naples. SUBJECTS: 63 subjects with primary type IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinaemia entered the study, and 44 completed it. Exclusion criteria were taking drugs known to influence lipid metabolism, evidence of cardiovascular disease, homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, and body mass index over 30. INTERVENTIONS: Two test diets with reduced saturated fat (8%) and cholesterol (approximately 200 mg/day): one was also low in total fat and rich in carbohydrate and fibre, and the other was low in carbohydrate and fibre and rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations; blood glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations before and after a test meal. RESULTS: In comparison with the control diet, both test diets induced significant and similar decreases in low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (by a mean of 0.72 (SE 0.15) mmol/l, P < 0.001, for low total fat diet; by 0.49 (0.18) mmol/l, P < 0.05, for high unsaturated fat diet) and plasma triglyceride concentrations (by 0.21 (0.09) mmol/l, P < 0.05, for low total fat diet; by 0.39 (0.15) mmol/l, P < 0.05, for high unsaturated fat diet), while high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations after fasting and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations during test meals were not modified by either diet.

A prospective study of dietary fat and risk of prostate cancer.,Giovannucci E; Rimm EB; Colditz GA; Stampfer MJ; Ascherio A; Chute CG; Willett WC,"BACKGROUND: The strong correlation between national consumption of fat and national rate of mortality from prostate cancer has raised the hypothesis that dietary fat increases the risk of this malignancy. Case-control and cohort studies have not consistently supported this hypothesis. PURPOSE: We examined prospectively the relationship between prostate cancer and dietary fat, including specific fatty acids and dietary sources of fat. We examined the relationship of fat consumption to the incidence of advanced prostate cancer (stages C, D, or fatal cases) and to the total incidence of prostate cancer. METHODS: We used data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which is a prospective cohort of 51529 U.S. men, aged 40 through 75, who completed a validated food-frequency questionnaire in 1986. We sent follow-up questionnaires to the entire cohort in 1988 and 1990 to document new cases of a variety of diseases and to update exposure information. As of January 31, 1990, 300 new cases of prostate cancer, including 126 advanced cases, were documented in 47855 participants initially free of diagnosed cancer. The Mantel-Haenszel summary estimator was used to adjust for age and other potentially confounding variables. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) when controlling simultaneously for more than two covariates. RESULTS: Total fat consumption was directly related to risk of advanced prostate cancer (age- and energy-adjusted RR = 1.79, with 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-3.07, for high versus low quintile of intake; P [trend] = .06). This association was due primarily to animal fat (RR = 1.63; 95% CI = 0.95-2.78; P [trend] = .08), but not vegetable fat. Red meat represented the food group with the strongest positive association with advanced cancer (RR = 2.64; 95% CI = 1.21-5.77; P = .02). Fat from dairy products (with the exception of butter) or fish was unrelated to risk. Saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and alpha-linolenic acid, but not linoleic acid, were associated with advanced prostate cancer risk; only the association with alpha-linolenic acid persisted when saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, linoleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid were modeled simultaneously (multivariate RR = 3.43; 95% CI = 1.67-7.04; P [trend] = .002). CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis that animal fat, especially fat from red meat, is associated with an elevated risk of advanced prostate cancer. IMPLICATIONS: These findings support recommendations to lower intake of meat to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The potential roles of carcinogens formed in cooking animal fat and of alpha-linolenic acid in the progression of prostate cancer need to be explored.",1993,Oct,J Natl Cancer Inst,85,19,1571-9,,10.1093/jnci/85.19.1571,8105097,#11683,Giovannucci 1993,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
A prospective cohort study on dietary fat and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.,van den Brandt PA; van't Veer P; Goldbohm RA; Dorant E; Volovics A; Hermus RJ; Sturmans F,"In 1986 a prospective cohort study on diet and cancer was started in the Netherlands among 62,573 women ages 55-69 years. Baseline information on diet and other risk factors was collected with a questionnaire. Cancer incidence was measured by record linkage with cancer registries and a pathology register. A case-cohort approach was used, in which the accumulated person time in the cohort was estimated by follow-up of a randomly selected subcohort (n = 1812). After 3.3 years of follow-up, 471 incident breast cancer cases were available for analysis. Questionnaire data for these cases and the 1716 female subcohort members without a history of cancer other than skin cancer were analyzed. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for traditional risk factors, the relative rates for breast cancer in increasing quintiles of energy-adjusted total fat intake were 1.00, 1.00, 1.34, 1.22, 1.08 (P-trend, 0.32). For saturated fat there was some evidence for a weak positive association when quintiles were used (relative rates in quintiles 1-5, 1.00, 1.22, 1.22, 1.38, 1.39; P-trend, 0.049). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the top quintile was 0.94-2.06, however; and when saturated fat was used as a continuous variable, the effect was no longer significant (P = 0.20). Relative rate estimates for the highest versus lowest quintiles of monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and cholesterol intake were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.50-1.12), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.64-1.40) and 1.09 (95% CI, 0.74-1.61), respectively, with no evidence for significant trends.

The aim of this pilot uncontrolled intervention trial was to assess the effect of a modified Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on weight loss and glucoregulation among overweight/obese adults. Eleven men and women with overweight/obesity, aged 37 ± 12 years, participated in a free-living intervention until 10% weight loss was achieved. Participants followed an individualized MedDiet high in monounsaturated fat and protein with decreased carbohydrate and saturated fat contents. Physical activity and dietary intake were monitored with pedometers and food records, respectively. Upon weight loss achievement, anthropometric measurements, blood metabolic profiles and individual responses to oral glucose and mixed-meal tests were evaluated pre- and post-intervention. The results showed significant ameliorations in body fat, waist circumference and leptin levels (p < 0.01), with concomitant increases in adiponectin-leptin ratios (p < 0.001). Glucoregulation was significantly improved according to glucose and insulin responses, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance indices and postprandial insulin sensitivity indices (p < 0.05).

Beyond protein intake: does dietary fat intake in the year preceding pregnancy and during pregnancy have an impact on gestational diabetes mellitus?,Qiao T; Chen Y; Duan R; Chen M; Xue H; Tian G; Liang Y; Zhang J; He F; Yang D; Gong Y; Zhou R; Cheng G,"PURPOSE: Studies regarding the association between dietary fat intake and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are limited and provide conflicting findings. Thus, the study aims to examine the association of dietary fat intake in the year preceding pregnancy and during pregnancy with the risk of GDM, taking the relevance of dietary protein intake on GDM into consideration. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 6299 singleton pregnancies, using the data from the Nutrition in Pregnancy and Growth in Southwest China (NPGSC). A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary fat intake in the year preceding pregnancy and during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the prospective associations of dietary fat intake and the type and source of dietary fats in different time windows with GDM risk. RESULTS: Higher intake of total fat [OR (95% CI): 2.21 (1.19-4.20), P = 0.02] during 12-22 weeks of gestation was associated with higher GDM risk. However, adjustment for animal protein intake greatly attenuated this association [OR (95% CI): 1.81 (0.93, 3.64), P = 0.11]. Total fat intake neither in the year preceding pregnancy nor during the early pregnancy was associated with GDM risk. Moreover, insignificant associations were observed between intakes of vegetable fat, animal fat, cholesterol, saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid one year before pregnancy and during the first and second trimesters and GDM risk.

After subjects met the inclusion criteria, they received a nutritional intervention with a high-fat hypocaloric diet [36% of carbohydrates, 40% of fats (60.0% of monounsaturated fats, 25.0% of saturated fats and 15.0% of polyunsaturated fats) and 24% of proteins]. Biochemical and anthropometric parameters were measured at basal and 3 months. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-nine subjects (64.6%) had the genotype AA (wild group) and 98 (35.4%) subjects had the next genotypes; AT (81 patients, 29.2%) or TT (17 patients, 6.2%) (Mutant group). The improvement of BMI, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, leptin, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol was similar in both genotypes after dietary intervention. Secondary to weight loss and only in non-T allele, insulin levels (AA vs. At+TT) (-5.2+0.2 UI/L vs. -2.9+0.3 UI/L: p=0.02) and HOMA-IR (-2.1+0.2 units vs. -1.1+0.1 units: p=0.02) decreased significantly.

Dietary-fat effect of the rs10830963 polymorphism in MTNR1B on insulin resistance in response to 3 months weight-loss diets.,de Luis DA; Izaola O; Primo D; Aller R,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The risk allele (G) of rs10830963 in the melatonin receptor 1 B (MTNR1B) gene presents an association with obesity. We study the effect of this SNP on cardiovascular risk factors and weight loss secondary to 2hypocaloric diets. METHODS: 361 obese subjects were randomly allocated during 3 months (Diet M - high monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet vs. Diet P - high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet). Anthropometric parameters, fasting blood glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin concentration, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile and adipocytokines levels were measured. Genotype of MTNR1B gene polymorphism (rs10830963) was evaluated. RESULTS: All anthropometric parameters, systolic blood pressure and leptin levels decreased in all subjects after both diets. This improvement of anthropometric parameters was higher in non G allele carriers than G allele carriers. After dietary intervention with Diet M, (CC vs. CG + GG); total cholesterol (delta: -10.4 ± 2.1mg/dl vs. -6.4 ± 1.2mg/dl: P <.05), LDL-cholesterol (delta:-7.1 ± 0.9mg/dl vs. -2.8 ± 0.8mg/dl: P <.05), insulin (delta:-3.0 ± 0.8 UI/L vs. -2.0 ± 1.0 UI/L: P<.05) and HOMA-IR (delta:-3.4 ± 1.0 units vs. -2.9 ± 0.9 units: P<.05) improved in no G allele carriers.

Effects of dietary fat on insulin secretion in subjects with the metabolic syndrome.,Gulseth HL; Gjelstad IMF; Tiereny AC; McCarthy D; Lovegrove JA; Defoort C; Blaak EE; Lopez-Miranda J; Dembinska-Kiec A; Risérus U; Roche HM; Drevon CA; Birkeland KI,"Objective Impaired insulin secretion and action contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Dietary fat modification may improve insulin sensitivity, whereas the effect on insulin secretion is unclear. We investigated the effect of dietary fat modification on insulin secretion in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. Design In a 12-week pan-European parallel, randomized controlled dietary intervention trial (LIPGENE), 486 subjects were assigned to four isoenergetic diets: high-fat diets rich in saturated fat (HSFA) or monounsaturated fat (HMUFA) or low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets with (LFHCC n-3) or without (LFHCC control) 1.2 g/day of n-3 PUFA supplementation. Insulin secretion was estimated as acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) and disposition index (DI), modeled from an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Results There were no overall effect of the dietary intervention on AIRg and DI in the total cohort, in neither the high-fat nor LFHCC groups. We observed significant diet*fasting glucose category interactions for AIRg (P = 0.021) and DI (P = 0.001) in the high-fat groups. In subjects with normal fasting glucose and preserved first phase insulin secretion, the HMUFA diet increased, whereas the HSFA diet reduced AIRg (P = 0.015) and DI (P = 0.010). Conclusions The effects of dietary fat modification on insulin secretion were minor, and only evident in normoglycemic subjects. In this case, the HMUFA diet improved AIRg and DI, as compared to the HSFA diet.",2019,May,Eur J Endocrinol,180,5,321-328,,10.1530/EJE-19-0022,30893645,#11714,Gulseth 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Dietary Intake of Energy and Nutrients from Breakfast and Risk of Stroke in The Japanese Population: The Circulatory Risk in Communities Study (CIRCS).,Okada C; Imano H; Yamagishi K; Cui R; Umesawa M; Maruyama K; Muraki I; Hayama-Terada M; Shimizu Y; Sankai T; Okada T; Kiyama M; Kitamura A; Iso H,"AIMS: The frequency of breakfast intake has been reported to be inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular events; however, it is uncertain what the impact of the energy and nutrient intakes from breakfast are. We assessed the association between these intakes from breakfast and the risk of stroke prospectively. METHODS: In a baseline survey of four Japanese communities between 1981 and 1990, we enrolled 3 248 residents (1 662 men and 1 586 women) aged 40-59 years who were free from stroke and heart disease and who responded to the 24-hour dietary recall survey. We assessed the dietary intake at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and other times separately. RESULTS: During the median 25-year follow-up, 230 individuals (147 men and 83 women) developed stroke. After adjustment for age, community, other dietary intakes, and lifestyle and physiological factors, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of intracerebral hemorrhage for the highest versus lowest quartiles of energy intake from breakfast were 0.38 (0.15-0.99) in men and 1.36 (0.36-5.10) in women. For the major nutrients, a higher saturated or monounsaturated fat intake at breakfast was associated with a reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in men, and remained statistically significant after further adjustment for intake of other major nutrients from breakfast.

Ad Libitum Mediterranean and Low-Fat Diets Both Significantly Reduce Hepatic Steatosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,Properzi C; O'Sullivan TA; Sherriff JL; Ching HL; Jeffrey GP; Buckley RF; Tibballs J; MacQuillan GC; Garas G; Adams LA,"Although diet-induced weight loss is first-line treatment for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), long-term maintenance is difficult. The optimal diet for improvement in either NAFLD or associated cardiometabolic risk factors, regardless of weight loss, is unknown. We examined the effect of two ad libitum isocaloric diets (Mediterranean [MD] or low fat [LF]) on hepatic steatosis (HS) and cardiometabolic risk factors. Subjects with NAFLD were randomized to a 12-week blinded dietary intervention (MD vs. LF). HS was determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). From a total of 56 subjects enrolled, 49 completed the intervention and 48 were included for analysis. During the intervention, subjects on the MD had significantly higher total and monounsaturated fat, but lower carbohydrate and sodium, intakes compared to LF subjects (P < 0.01). At week 12, HS had reduced significantly in both groups (P < 0.01), and there was no difference in liver fat reduction between groups (P = 0.32), with mean (SD) relative reductions of 25.0% (±25.3%) in LF and 32.4% (±25.5%) in MD. Liver enzymes also improved significantly in both groups. Weight loss was minimal and not different between groups (-1.6 [±2.1] kg in LF vs -2.1 [±2.5] kg in MD; P = 0.52). Within-group improvements in Framingham Risk Score (FRS), total cholesterol, serum triglyceride (TG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were observed in the MD (all P < 0.05), but not with the LF diet.

"A Mediterranean diet and risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke: A population-based cohort study.",Tektonidis TG; Åkesson A; Gigante B; Wolk A; Larsson SC,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Mediterranean diet, which is palatable and easily achievable, has been associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality. Data on heart failure (HF) and stroke types are lacking. The aim was to examine a Mediterranean diet in relation to incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), HF and stroke types in a Swedish prospective cohort. METHODS: In a population-based cohort of 32,921 women, diet was assessed through a self-administered questionnaire. The modified Mediterranean diet (mMED) score was created based on high consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fermented dairy products, fish and monounsaturated fat, moderate intakes of alcohol and low consumption of red meat, on a 0-8 scale. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for potential confounders, were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: During 10 y of follow-up (1998-2008), 1109 MIs, 1648 HFs, 1270 ischemic strokes and 262 total hemorrhagic strokes were ascertained. A high adherence to the mMED score (6-8), compared to low, was associated with a lower risk of MI (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61-0.90, p = 0.003), HF (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68-0.93, p = 0.004) and ischemic stroke (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.93, p = 0.007), but not hemorrhagic stroke (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.61-1.29, p = 0.53).

Dietary fat intake and risk of ovarian cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.,Blank MM; Wentzensen N; Murphy MA; Hollenbeck A; Park Y,"BACKGROUND: Fat intake has been postulated to increase risk of ovarian cancer, but previous studies have reported inconsistent results. METHODS: The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a large prospective cohort, assessed diet using a food frequency questionnaire at baseline in 1995-1996. During an average of 9 years of follow-up, 695 ovarian cancer cases were ascertained through the state cancer registry database. The relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Women in the highest vs the lowest quintile of total fat intake had a 28% increased risk of ovarian cancer (RR(Q5 vs Q1)=1.28, 95% CI: 1.01-1.63). Fat intake from animal sources (RR(Q5 vs Q1)=1.30; 95% CI: 1.02-1.66), but not from plant sources, was positively associated with ovarian cancer risk. Saturated and monounsaturated fat intakes were not related to risk of ovarian cancer, but polyunsaturated fat intake showed a weak positive association. The association between total fat intake and ovarian cancer was stronger in women who were nulliparous or never used oral contraceptives.

"Association of dietary fat, vegetables and antioxidant micronutrients with skin ageing in Japanese women.",Nagata C; Nakamura K; Wada K; Oba S; Hayashi M; Takeda N; Yasuda K,"Daily diet may have implications for skin ageing. However, data on the relationship between diet and the parameters of skin conditions are scarce. The present study aimed to examine the associations of biophysical properties of the skin of women with intakes of fats and antioxidant micronutrients as well as food groups as sources of these nutrients. In a cross-sectional study, we measured the hydration, surface lipids and elasticity of the skin of 716 Japanese women using non-invasive techniques. The extent of facial wrinkles in the crow's-foot area was determined by observation using the Daniell scale. Each subject's usual diet was determined with the use of a validated FFQ. After controlling for covariates including age, smoking status, BMI and lifetime sun exposure, the results showed that higher intakes of total fat, saturated fat and monounsaturated fat were significantly associated with increased skin elasticity. A higher intake of green and yellow vegetables was significantly associated with a decreased Daniell wrinkling score. Intake of saturated fat was significantly inversely associated with the Daniell wrinkling score after additional adjustment for green and yellow vegetable intake.

Determining optimal approaches for weight maintenance: a randomized controlled trial.,Dale KS; McAuley KA; Taylor RW; Williams SM; Farmer VL; Hansen P; Vorgers SM; Chisholm AW; Mann JI,"BACKGROUND: Weight regain often occurs after weight loss in overweight individuals. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of 2 support programs and 2 diets of different macronutrient compositions intended to facilitate long-term weight maintenance. METHODS: Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 200 women who had lost 5% or more of their initial body weight to an intensive support program (implemented by nutrition and activity specialists) or to an inexpensive nurse-led program (involving ""weigh-ins"" and encouragement) that included advice about high-carbohydrate diets or relatively high-monounsaturated-fat diets. RESULTS: In total, 174 (87%) participants were followed-up for 2 years. The average weight loss (about 2 kg) did not differ between those in the support programs (0.1 kg, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.8 to 1.9, p = 0.95) or diets (0.7 kg, 95% CI -1.1 to 2.4, p = 0.46).

Fat intake influences the effect of the hepatic lipase C-514T polymorphism on HDL-cholesterol levels in children.,Riestra P; López-Simón L; Ortega H; Gorgojo L; Martin-Moreno JM; Schoppen S; de Oya M; Garcés C,"Polymorphisms in the hepatic lipase gene have been associated with variability in plasma HDL-C concentrations, but contradictory results have been reported regarding the effect of diet on this association in adults. In our study, we examined whether dietary fat intake modified the association between lipid levels and the C-514T polymorphism in the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC C-514T) in prepubescent children. The LIPC C-514T polymorphism was determined by PCR and restriction analysis in 1260 healthy school children, aged 6-8. Information on the children's nutrient intake was obtained by means of a validated food frequency questionnaire. We found that regardless of gender, carriers of the minor allele had significantly higher apo A-I levels compared to noncarrier subjects. The effect of the polymorphism, however, was modified by dietary fat intake. In boys, the presence of the LIPC C-514T polymorphism was associated with significantly higher HDL-C among children within the highest tertiles of total, saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fat intake. Apo A-I levels were significantly higher in carriers of the LIPC C-514T polymorphism, but only among boys who consumed high total as well as monounsaturated fat and among girls who consumed high total, saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat. Our data show that dietary fat intake modifies the effect of the LIPC C-514T polymorphism on plasma HDL-C and apo A-I levels in prepubescent children, being associated with higher levels of HDL-C and apo A-I only when fat intake is high.

Quantitative trait locus determining dietary macronutrient intakes is located on human chromosome 2p22.,Cai G; Cole SA; Bastarrachea RA; Maccluer JW; Blangero J; Comuzzie AG,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is generally accompanied by increased food intake. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the genes influencing variation in dietary macronutrient intakes in Mexican Americans. DESIGN: We conducted a genome-wide scan by using data derived from food-frequency questionnaires in 816 participants from the San Antonio Family Heart Study. Household effect was simultaneously estimated in a variance component model with the use of SOLAR. RESULTS: All dietary intake measures (total calories, proteins, fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, carbohydrates, and sucrose) were moderately heritable. Household effect was insignificant except on total calories and sucrose. Suggestive evidence of linkage with saturated fat intake was found on chromosome 2p22 near marker D2S1346 [logarithm of odds (LOD) = 2.62]. Intakes of total calories, fat, protein, and monounsaturated fat were also suggestively linked to the same marker. A significant linkage signal on chromosome 2p22 for leptin concentrations and fat mass was localized in this population, so we used leptin or fat mass as a covariate. Multipoint LOD scores for saturated fat dropped to 1.27 and 1.90, respectively, which suggested that this region on chromosome 2p contributes to both saturated fat intake and body adiposity. This chromosomal region contains the proopiomelanocortin gene (POMC). However, 2 polymorphisms in exon 3 of the POMC gene showed no association with saturated fat intake.

S. in the early 20(th) century is thought to have altered the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether similar effects include changes in the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not clear. This report describes the relations between environmental, life-style, and physical attributes and the incidence of PD that have been observed in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. METHODS: Beginning in 1965, environmental, life-style, and physical attributes were recorded at selected examinations in a cohort of 8,006 Japanese-American men. Subjects were followed for clinical PD. FINDINGS: During 30 years of follow- up, PD was observed in 137 men. Overall incidence (7.1/10,000 person-years) was generally higher than in Asia and similar to rates observed in Europe and the U. S. Precursors of PD included constipation, adiposity, years worked on a sugar or pineapple plantation, years of exposure to pesticides, and exposure to sugar cane processing. Factors showing an inverse association with PD included coffee intake and cigarette smoking. Among dietary factors, carbohydrates increased the risk of PD while the intake of polyunsaturated fats appeared protective. Total caloric intake, saturated and monounsaturated fats, protein, niacin, riboflavin, beta-carotene, vitamins A, B, and C, dietary cholesterol, cobalamin, alpha-tocopherol, and pantothenic acid showed no clear relation with clinical PD.

Results of use of metformin and replacement of starch with saturated fat in diets of patients with type 2 diabetes.,Hays JH; Gorman RT; Shakir KM,"OBJECTIVE: To improve glycemic control by substituting saturated fat for starch, to identify any adverse effect on lipids masked by the extensive use of metformin and lipid-lowering drugs, and to attempt to separate dietary effects from effects of multiple drugs. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of medical records of patients who completed 1 year of follow-up after dietary prescription. The study subjects included 151 patients in the diet group (whose dietary instructions included high saturated fat but starch avoidance) and 132 historical control subjects (who were allowed unlimited monounsaturated fat but had restriction of starch in their diets). RESULTS: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels improved in both study groups (-1.4 +/- 0.2% [P<0.001]; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.9 to -0.9). Use of metformin was associated with a decrease in HbA1c (-0.12 +/- 0.003%/mo [P<0.001]; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.07). The diet group had an additional decrease of -0.7 +/- 0.2% (P<0.001; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.3).

Relationships between types of fat consumed and serum estrogen and androgen concentrations in Japanese men.,Nagata C; Takatsuka N; Kawakami N; Shimizu H,"The relationships between types of fat consumed and serum concentrations of estrone, estradiol, total and free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were examined in 69 Japanese men aged 43-88 years. Diet was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Intake of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats was inversely correlated with serum total testosterone after controlling for age, total energy, body mass index, alcohol intake, and smoking status, but the correlation was statistically significant only for polyunsaturated fat (r = -0.29, p = 0.02).

"Dietary intake and biochemical, hematologic, and immune status of vegans compared with nonvegetarians.",Haddad EH; Berk LS; Kettering JD; Hubbard RW; Peters WR,"Dietary and nutritional status of individuals habitually consuming a vegan diet was evaluated by biochemical, hematologic, and immunologic measures in comparison with a nonvegetarian group. On the basis of 4-d dietary records, the intake of female and male vegans tended to be lower in fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and cholesterol and higher in dietary fiber than that of vegetarians. With computed food and supplement intakes, vegan diets provided significantly higher amounts of ascorbate, folate, magnesium, copper, and manganese in both female and male participants. The body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) of the vegans was significantly lower than that of the nonvegetarians and 9 of the 25 vegans had a BMI <19. Serum ferritin concentrations were significantly lower in vegan men but iron and zinc status did not differ between the sexes. Mean serum vitamin B-12 and methylmalonic acid concentrations did not differ; however, 10 of the 25 vegans showed a vitamin B-12 deficit manifested by macrocytosis, circulating vitamin B-12 concentrations <150 pmol/L, or serum methylmalonic acid >376 nmol/L.

Effects of Mediterranean diet on lipid levels and cardiovascular risk in renal transplant recipients.,Barbagallo CM; Cefalù AB; Gallo S; Rizzo M; Noto D; Cavera G; Rao Camemi A; Marino G; Caldarella R; Notarbartolo A; Averna MR,"BACKGROUND: Renal transplant recipients have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. These patients present abnormalities of lipoprotein profile which are persistent and involve an increasing number of individuals, suggesting the opportunity of an early therapeutic intervention. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of a 10- to 12-week diet based on the American Heart Association step-one diet criteria, modified with an increased intake of monounsaturated fats and alimentary fibers, on lipid profile and lipid-related cardiovascular risk in 78 normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic renal transplant recipients. RESULTS: Diet led to a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels by 10%, triglycerides by 6.5%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by 10.4% and LDL-cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio by 10%, whereas HDL-cholesterol levels remained unchanged. Dividing renal transplant recipients into risk classes according to the National Cholesterol Expert Program guidelines and LDL-cholesterol levels, we observed a progressively increasing reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels among 'desirable LDL-cholesterol', 'borderline high-risk LDL-cholesterol' and 'high-risk LDL-cholesterol' patients, while HDL-cholesterol levels did not change in any group and the LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio significantly decreased in 'borderline high-risk LDL-cholesterol' and in 'high-risk LDL-cholesterol' patients (respectively by 6.8%, p < 0.05, and by 21.1%, p < 0.0001). Reduction in triglyceride levels was statistically significant only in subjects with 'desirable LDL-cholesterol' (by 12.3%, p < 0.01). Patients in the 'desirable LDL-cholesterol' class increased from 28 (35.9% of total patients) before diet to 45 (57.7% of total patients, p < 0.01), while subjects in the 'high-risk LDL-cholesterol' class reduced from 24 (30.8% of total patients) to 8 (10.2% of total patients, p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These data suggest the possibility of a nutritional hypolipidemic approach in renal transplant recipients, even if normolipidemic. Dietetic treatment determined an inversion in the typical trend of renal transplant recipients, reducing instead of increasing the number of subjects with hypercholesterolemia, permitting the selection of individual candidates for further pharmacological treatment by carefully evaluating risk/benefit costs.",1999,,Nephron,82,3,199-204,,10.1159/000045403,10395991,#11804,Barbagallo 1999,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Relationships between dietary fat, body fat, and serum lipid profile in prepubertal children.",Ku CY; Gower BA; Nagy TR; Goran MI,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that dietary fat components were associated with the serum lipid profile independent of ethnicity, body fat, and fat distribution in prepubertal children. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Sixty-six children (45 African American and 21 Caucasian), aged from 4 to 10 years, were recruited into the study. Dietary total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and polyunsaturated fat were estimated by averaging two 24-hour diet recalls. Fasting serum triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were analyzed, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated by the method of Friedewald. Body composition and fat distribution were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography. RESULTS: Children in both ethnic groups tended to overreport their dietary intake relative to total energy expenditure by 18%. African American children consumed more energy from total fat (35.3% vs. 31.5%, p<0.05), saturated fat (13.7% vs 12.2%, p<0.05), protein (16.4% vs. 13.2%, p=0.02), and less from carbohydrate (48% vs. 57.1%, p<0.01) than Caucasian children. There was no significant correlation between dietary fat and either serum lipids or body fat indices after adjusting for nonfat energy intake and total lean tissue mass. Total body fat (r=0.32), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (r=0.39), and intra-abdominal adipose tissue (r=0.42) were positively related to serum triacylglycerol; these associations remained significant in a multiple linear regression model in which body fat indices were adjusted for ethnicity, total lean tissue, dietary total fat, and nonfat intake. DISCUSSION: Our results do not support a link between dietary fat and serum lipids; instead, our data suggest that body fat may play a more important role than dietary fat in the course of cardiovascular disease development in prepubertal children.",1998,Nov,Obes Res,6,6,400-7,,10.1002/j.1550-8528.1998.tb00371.x,9845229,#11809,Ku 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Effects of dietary fat modification on fibrinogen, factor VII, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.",Niskanen L; Schwab US; Sarkkinen ES; Krusius T; Vahtera E; Uusitupa MI,"Our aim was to assess the impact of a monounsaturated fat-enriched (Mono) diet and a diet recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) on plasma levels of fibrinogen and activities of factor VII (FVII:C) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and the impact of genetic polymorphisms of these variables (HaeIII, MspI, and 4G/5G polymorphisms, respectively) in 28 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance ([IGT] 17 men and 11 women; mean age, 55.6 +/- 5.5 years). A diet rich in fat and saturated fatty acids served as a baseline diet for 3 weeks. Thereafter, subjects were randomized for the next 8 weeks to either the Mono diet (n = 12) or NCEP diet (n = 18). Fibrinogen levels or PAI-1 activities did not change with either of the diets, but fibrinogen levels were higher (3.4 +/- 0.5 v 4.0 +/- 0.6 g/L, P = .007 at baseline) throughout the study in heterozygous subjects with respect to HaeIII polymorphism. This polymorphism and age accounted for 38% of the variation of fibrinogen levels. MspI polymorphism together with body mass index explained 51% of the variation of FVII:C, which was higher in subjects with the M1M1 genotype compared with M1M2/M2M2 genotypes (127% +/- 21% v 90% +/- 12%, P < .001). FVII:C showed a decrease with the NCEP diet (P < .05), but the decline was confined to M1M1 subjects. PAI-1 activity did not differ significantly between the genotypes. The insulin sensitivity index (SI) obtained by the minimal model method was the main explanatory variable of PAI-1 activity. To conclude, despite good compliance, the fat-modified diet did not alter plasma levels of fibrinogen or PAI-1 in white subjects with IGT. FVII:C levels decreased with the NCEP diet, but this was confined to subjects with the M1M1 genotype.",1997,Jun,Metabolism,46,6,666-72,,10.1016/s0026-0495(97)90011-1,9186303,#11814,Niskanen 1997,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
"Dietary factors and risk of colon cancer: a prospective study of 50,535 young Norwegian men and women.",Gaard M; Tretli S; Løken EB,"The relationship of meat, fish, fat, fibre or calcium consumption to the risk of colon cancer was examined in a prospective study conducted by the Norwegian National Health Screening Service. Between 1977 and 1983, 50,535 Norwegian men and women aged 20-54 attended the health screening and completed a semi-quantitative questionnaire about food frequency. During a mean follow-up of 11.4 years, 143 cases of colon cancer were identified for analyses through a link with the Norwegian Cancer Registry. The relative risk of colon cancer was 3.5 (95% CI, 1.02-11.9) in women who consumed sausages as their main meal five or more times a month, compared with the risk in those who reported a consumption frequency of less than once a month. There was an increase in the relative risk with increasing frequency of consumption (P for linear trends = 0.03). Among men, the association was not statistically significant, but the trend was in the same direction as that of the women. The frequency of consuming meat meals in general, including meat stews, roasted meat, meat balls, fish or milk, was not associated with a risk of colon cancer. No trends in relative risks of colon cancer were found to be associated with intake of total energy intake or with energy-adjusted intake of total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, dietary fibre or calcium. In conclusions, this prospective study provided no evidence of association between intake of meat, fish, fat, energy, fibre or calcium and risk of colon cancer, although an increased risk with frequent consumption of sausages was suggested.",1996,Dec,Eur J Cancer Prev,5,6,445-54,,,9061275,#11817,Gaard 1996,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
Adult dietary intake and prostate cancer risk in Utah: a case-control study with special emphasis on aggressive tumors.,West DW; Slattery ML; Robison LM; French TK; Mahoney AW,"A population-based case-control study in Utah of 358 cases diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1984 and 1985, and 679 controls categorically matched by age and county of residence, were interviewed to investigate the association between dietary intake of energy (kcal), fat, protein, vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin C, zinc, cadmium, selenium, and prostate cancer. Dietary data were ascertained using a quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Data were analyzed separately by age (45-67, 68-74) and by tumor aggressiveness. The most significant associations were seen for older males and aggressive tumors. Dietary fat was the strongest risk factor for these males, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 1.0-8.4) for total fat; OR = 2.2 (CI = 0.7-6.6) for saturated fat; OR = 3.6 (CI = 1.3-9.7) for monounsaturated fat; and OR = 2.7 (CI = 1.1-6.8) for polyunsaturated fat. Protein and carbohydrates had positive but nonsignificant associations. Energy intake had an OR of 2.5 (CI = 1.0-6.5). In these older men, no effects were seen for dietary cholesterol, body mass, or physical activity. There was little association between prostate cancer and dietary intake of zinc, cadmium, selenium, vitamin C, and beta-carotene. Total vitamin A had a slight positive association with all prostate cancer (OR = 1.6, CI = 0.9-2.4), but not with aggressive tumors. No associations were found in younger males, with the exception of physical activity which showed active males to be at an increased but nonsignificant risk for aggressive tumors (OR = 2.0, CI = 0.8-5.2) and beta-carotene which showed a nonsignificant protective effect (OR = 0.6, CI = 0.3-1.6). The findings suggest that dietary intake, especially fats, may increase risk of aggressive prostate tumors in older males.",1991,Mar,Cancer Causes Control,2,2,85-94,,10.1007/BF00053126,1873441,#11836,West 1991,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

An Experimental Ketogenic Diet for Alzheimer Disease Was Nutritionally Dense and Rich in Vegetables and Avocado,"Taylor, MK; Swerdlow, RH; Burns, JM; Sullivan, DK","Background: The ketogenic diet (KD) has gained interest as a potential therapy for numerous conditions; however, studies rarely report the food and micronutrient profile of the diet.Objective: The aim of this study was to report changes in food selection and nutritional quality from the baseline diet (BD) to a KD therapy in participants with Alzheimer disease (AD).Methods: Fifteen AD patients participated in a single-arm clinical trial to assess the feasibility of a 3-mo KD intervention. A registered dietitian instructed participant study partners to assist participants with a self-selected, nutritionally dense KD. We collected food and nutrient intake via monthly 3-d food records. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate was measured within 48 h of each 3-d food record to assess ketosis status. Food records before KD initiation characterized the BD. Food records during the intervention coincident with the most robust ketosis characterized the KD. Principal components analysis identified foods affiliated with the BD and KD. Mean food and nutrient intake change was tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test for variance with significance set at P <= 0.025.Results: Ten participants adhered to the KD. Study partners provided complete food records for 6 KD-adherent individuals. The KD was characterized by increased medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, nonstarchy vegetables, butter, eggs, olive oil, avocados, and nuts and seeds with practical elimination of potatoes, grains, red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and desserts. Fruit intake, including avocado, was similar between diets. Nonstarchy vegetable intake increased from 1.2 servings/d to 4.3 servings/d (P < 0.01) on the KD. Micronutrient intake was similar between diets, meeting Dietary Reference Intakes for most nutrients.

Food intolerance related to gastrointestinal symptoms amongst adults living with bile acid diarrhoea: A cross-sectional study,"McKenzie, YA; French, C; Todd, C; Burden, S","BackgroundThe role of food in managing bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) is poorly understood. The present study explored the prevalence of food intolerance amongst adults with BAD.MethodsThe study comprised a cross-sectional survey of adults with BAD determined by the 75selenium homotaurocholic acid test (SeHCAT) living in the UK. Participants anonymously completed an online questionnaire on 39 food items. Frequency of food in general affecting BAD symptoms, as well as frequencies of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and consequential food avoidance after food item ingestion, were assessed. Food group avoidance was also assessed.ResultsThere were 434 participants who completed the questionnaire between April and May 2021 of whom 80% reported moderate to severe chronic diarrhoea. Food intolerances were reported by 88.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 84.6-90.9) of participants. Diarrhoea was reported most frequently after take-away food, fish and chips, creamy sauces, cream and large quantities of fruit (range 41.0%-33.6%). Lowest frequencies were for potato, avocado, mango, watermelon and pear (range 3.7%-7.4%) for the foods listed in the questionnaire. Similar trends were found for abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and consequential food avoidance. Symptom-triggering within 30 min of ingestion was more prevalence than after 30 min for almost all foods. Food group avoidance was highest for fatty foods (81.2%; 95% CI = 77.8-85.3) followed by dairy (53.9%; 95% CI = 49.1-58.7).ConclusionsPerceived food intolerance amongst adults with BAD and persisting diarrhoeal symptoms is high. Important triggers were meals with a higher fat content and higher-fat dairy products. Diets amongst those with persisting diarrhoeal symptoms may be overly restrictive.Bile acid diarrhoea is a common, underappreciated disorder, with an unmet need to improve treatment. The present study explored the prevalence of food intolerance amongst adults with BAD. Important triggers were meals with a higher fat content and higher-fat dairy products.

The aim of this study was to examine associations between a posteriori dietary patterns and the metabolic syndrome in an older New Zealand population. The REACH study (Researching Eating, Activity, and Cognitive Health) included 366 participants (aged 65-74 years, 36 % male) living independently in Auckland, New Zealand. Dietary data were collected using a 109-item FFQ with demonstrated validity and reproducibility for assessing dietary patterns using principal component analysis. The metabolic syndrome was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Associations between dietary patterns and the metabolic syndrome, adjusted for age, sex, index of multiple deprivation, physical activity, and energy intake were analysed using logistic regression analysis. Three dietary patterns explained 18 % of dietary intake variation - 'Mediterranean style' (salad/leafy cruciferous/other vegetables, avocados/olives, alliums, nuts/seeds, shellfish and white/oily fish, berries), 'prudent' (dried/fresh/frozen legumes, soya-based foods, whole grains and carrots) and 'Western' (processed meat/fish, sauces/condiments, cakes/biscuits/puddings and meat pies/hot chips). No associations were seen between 'Mediterranean style' (OR = 0 center dot 75 (95 % CI 0 center dot 53, 1 center dot 06), P = 0 center dot 11) or 'prudent' (OR = 1 center dot 17 (95 % CI 0 center dot 83, 1 center dot 59), P = 0 center dot 35) patterns and the metabolic syndrome after co-variate adjustment.

" Continuous Glucose Monitoring and Hass Avocado Trial (""CHAT"")"," NCT05293340,"," In this study, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be used to quantify changes in glycemic control in Hispanic/Latino adults with and at‐risk of T2D before and after receiving free avocado vouchers. The impact of using CGM to determine the effect of improving access to avocados on glycemic profiles and food related‐behaviors for Hispanic/Latino adults with or at risk of T2D is not known at present. To address this need, increased avocado consumption will be combined with CGM to assess post‐prandial glucose responses. This is based on evidence showing that one half of a Hass avocado at lunch is associated with increased satisfaction and reduced desire to eat over the subsequent 3‐5 hours in overweight or obese adults. For CGM, there is a lack of prospective data on the relationship between derived metrics and complications for adults with non‐insulin treated T2D or at‐risk of T2D, but glucose profiles from non‐diabetic subjects suggest very tight glycemic control, with only brief postprandial excursions >140 mg/dL. Cross‐sectional data suggests more time spent between 140 and 180 mg/dl comparing predominantly Mexican American adults at risk of T2D to adults with pre‐T2D and to adults with diagnosed T2D. Further, in a study examining the thresholds for CGM at which vascular disease can be detected, Lu and colleagues reported time in ranges above 140 mg/dL was associated with abnormal values for retinopathy and carotid intima‐medial thickness, a measure of macrovascular disease risk. Hence, the focus in this study will be time in range between 140 and 180 mg/dl between 6 am and 12 am (waking hours).",2022,,,,,, CN-02391620,,,#13816,NCT05293340 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong article type; ,

 The impact of avocado fruit on postprandial markers of cardio-metabolic risk: an acute dose response study," Park, E;  Huang, Y;  Xiao, D;  Edirisinghe, I;  Burton-Freeman, BM"," Avocados are a distinctive fruit characterized by their nutrient‐rich content including monounsaturated fat (MUFA), fiber and a number of essential micronutrients and bioactive phytochemicals. The aim of the present study was to assess the acute effects of two intake levels of avocado compared to no avocado on postprandial indices of metabolic and vascular health including glucose, insulin, lipids, and flow‐mediated dilation (FMD) and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress/damage. A single‐center, randomized, 3‐arm, controlled, 6‐h postprandial, crossover study was conducted in relatively healthy overweight/obese middle‐aged adults (n=31). Participants consumed a standardized Western‐style breakfast (640 kcal) containing 0 mg (Control), 68g (∼ 1/2 Hass avocado, Half‐A) or 136 g (∼ 1 Hass avocado, Whole‐A) on three separate occasions. Increasing the MUFA and fiber content of the meal by replacing calories from carbohydrate with calories from avocados decreased the postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses to meals over 6 h, independent of dose, compared to the Control meal (both p<0.0001). FMD (% change) was significantly increased with avocado in the meals (treatments and treatment by time interaction, p<0.01 and p<0.005, respectively (percent Mean FMD ± SEM for Half‐A: baseline 5.2 ± 0.9%, 1‐h 9.0 ± 0.9% and 3‐h 11.5% ± 0.9%; Whole‐A: baseline 5.4 ± 0.9%, 1‐h 10.6 ± 0.9%, 3‐h 10.5 ± 0.9%; Control: baseline 5.6 ± 0.9%, 1‐h 5.0 ± 0.9%, 3‐h 7.4 ± 0.9%). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of lipids/lipoprotein particles indicated modified lipoprotein metabolism with Whole‐A consumption vs Control. Briefly, lower concentrations of postprandial triglyceride rich lipoprotein particles after the Whole‐A compared to the Control meal (p=0.02) were evident. A trend for treatment differences in the metabolism of LDL and HDL particles were also apparent with indication of differences by race/ethnicity on some outcomes (p<0.05). No differences in the concentrations of oxidized LDL, MCP‐1, IL‐6 were observed over time or between meals, although TNF‐α tended to be lower after Whole‐A vs Control meal (p=0.07). The present study provides important insight regarding the acute metabolic and cardio‐vascular benefits of incorporating avocados into a meal. Avocado meals improved postprandial glucose, insulin and lipid profiles with concomitant improvements in vascular reactivity as measured by FMD in middle‐aged, overweight/obese adults. The data contribute to a growing body of evidence revealing the health benefits of avocados.",2017,,,31,1,, CN-01725148,,,#13821,Park 2017,Exclusion reason: Abstract only; ,
 Effects of Avocado When Added to a Meat Patty on Inflammation in Healthy Men," NCT01397071,"," Avocados are naturally rich in antioxidants, or beneficial compounds, that can help prevent many diseases, like atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). When foods that are high in fats are eaten, certain harmful compounds can be absorbed, which can lead to atherosclerosis. One harmful compound is called malondialdehyde, or MDA. This compound can be measured in the blood and the urine after a person eats a high fat meal. Antioxidants found in herbs and spices may lower the absorption of MDA, which could help prevent the development of atherosclerosis. This study will determine whether the beneficial compounds of avocado can reduce absorption of MDA. This will be tested by asking healthy males to eat a high fat ground beef patty with or without avocado and then measuring the amount of MDA in their blood and urine samples. Blood flow will also be measured. Healthy men have been chosen for this study because eating high fat hamburger patties can easily mimic in them the condition that causes atherosclerosis. Avocadoes are rich in antioxidiants, which have been shown in previous studies to reduce the absorption of harmful compounds, like MDA, that are formed during cooking. The results from this study may help to explain how high fat foods can be harmful to the body and how beneficial antioxidants from herbs and spices can protect the body. This will be determined from blood and urine samples after the subjects are given two different meals: a) a plain cooked ground beef patty, and b) or avocado with a cooked ground beef patty.",2011,,,,,, CN-01592048,,,#13823,NCT01397071 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong article type; ,

 Effects of avocado incorporation in meals on satiety and gastro intestinal peptides release in humans," Sabate, J;  Wien, M;  Haddad, E"," Introduction: Food ingestion is a complex process involving various biological and psychological determinants. Avocados are nutrient dense foods, with characteristics that may favorably impact energy balance. Objectives: Evaluate if incorporating one half Hass avocado by addition or inclusion into lunch meal influences post‐ingestive satiety and hormones response in overweight adults Method / Design: In a cross‐over fashion, 26 healthy subjects (mean BMI of 28.1) consumed 3 lunch test meals: Control (C); Avocado Inclusive (AI) a meal containing avocado matched with C for energy; and Avocado Added (AA) the C meal plus avocado. Blood samples obtained before and at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3h following lunch were assayed for insulin, ghrelin, leptin, GIP, glucagon‐like peptide‐1, and PYY. Visual analog scales (VAS) were administered at the same previous times to assess subjective feeling related to satiety. The area under the curve was computed for VAS and biological measures. Results: We found significant differences in self‐reported feelings of satisfaction and lesser desire to eat in the mixed model analysis. Compared to the C lunch, the AI and AA lunches increased satisfaction by 22% and 26% respectively, and decreased the desire to eat by 24% and 40% respectively. Compared to the AI lunch, blood insulin was higher after the C and AA lunches, leptin was also different for the AI and AA compared to control Conclusions: The inclusion or addition of one half avocado to a lunch meal favorably increased satisfaction, and reduced the desire to eat over a subsequent 3 hour period in overweight adults. The biological changes in insulin and leptin related to avocado intake deserves further study, since may provide clues for energy balance and weight control.",2015,,,67,,445, CN-01471403, 10.1159/000440895,,#13826,Sabate 2015,Exclusion reason: Abstract only; ,
 One avocado per day lowers plasma oxidized-LDL and increases plasma antioxidants in overweight and obese adults," Wang, L;  Tao, L;  Stanley, TH;  Fleming, JA;  Lambert, JD;  Kris-Etherton, PM"," Background: Avocados are a nutrient dense source of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and also are high in antioxidants. A previous study has shown that avocados have additional LDL‐C lowering effects beyond their MUFA content, especially on small, dense LDL particles, which are susceptible to oxidation in vivo. However, there is little information about the effects of avocados on oxidative stress. Methods and Result: A randomized, cross‐over, controlled feeding trial was conducted with 45 healthy, but overweight or obese participants with a baseline LDL‐C in the 25‐90th percentile. Three cholesterol‐lowering diets (6‐7% SFA) were fed (for 5 weeks each): a lower‐fat diet (LF: 24% fat); two moderate fat diets (34% fat) that provided similar foods and were matched for macronutrients and fatty acids: the avocado diet (AV) included one fresh Hass avocado (136 g) per day whereas the moderate fat diet (MF) used high oleic acid oils mainly to match the fatty acid content of one avocado. Compared to the baseline, only the AV diet decreased oxLDL (‐7.0 U/L, ‐8.8%, p=0.0004) whereas the LF (‐1.6 U/L p=0.1) and the MF diets (‐3.2 U/L, p=0.2) did not affect oxLDL significantly. Moreover, plasma oxLDL after consumption of the AV diet was significantly lower (p=0.05 and 0.03) than the MF and LF diets. HPLC analysis showed that only the AV diet increased plasma lutein by 68.7% from baseline (p<0.0001), and the increase in lutein by the AV diet was significantly greater than the increase by the MF (21.1%, p=0.7) and LF (37.6%, p=0.1) diets. Both MF and AV diets significantly increased plasma α‐carotene (72.8% and 68.4%, p<0.01 for both) and β‐carotene (15.4% and 12%, p<0.05 for both) from baseline. The LF diet did not change plasma antioxidant vitamins significantly, except for a decrease in γ‐tocopherol (‐7.8%, p=0.03). All three diets did not change plasma F2‐isoprotane significantly from baseline. The change in oxLDL was significantly correlated with the change in small LDL‐P (r=0.32, p=0.0002) and small, dense LDL‐C (r=0.47, p<0.0001) by not large LDL‐P (r=0.15, p=0.09) or large, buoyant LDL‐C (r=‐0.03, p=0.8). Conclusion: Including one avocado per day in a heart‐healthy diet lowers plasma oxidized LDL and lutein concentration; the benefits extend beyond their fatty acid content. The change in oxidized LDL by diet was correlated with a change in small LDL but not large LDL particles.",2015,,,131,,, CN-01088008,,,#13830,Wang 2015,Exclusion reason: Abstract only; ,
 Provitamin A Absorption and Conversion With Avocados," NCT01432210,", The primary objective of this study will be to demonstrate that adding avocados to a carotene rich meal will promote the absorption of provitamin A carotenoids and enhance the delivery of greater quantities of vitamin A.

 Dietary Exchanges With Avocado and Mango in Pre-diabetes," NCT05353790,"," Recruited subjects must meet all eligibility criteria, sign and date a written Institutional Review Board (IRB)‐approved Informed Consent Form. The trial will test 2 dietary conditions which will be fresh fruit (1 avocado and 1 mango) compared to a control arm matched in calories (but not macronutrients or fiber) equivalent to 1 fresh Hass avocado + 1 cup of mango per day. Participants will be given general meal plans, including specific foods assnacks or meals to include in their diet daily. ‐ Pre‐Screening To learn more about the study and to pre‐qualify, potential subjects can call the CNRC or visit the website posted on recruitment flyers or from other recruitment materials. If they call the CNRC, a staff member will provide a brief background on the study and ask a series of questions from a pre‐screening questionnaire to see if they may be eligible to participate. The same questionnaire is available on the website and can be filled out by potential subjects online. The pre‐screening questionnaire includes self‐reported information about health status and lifestyle factors that can be used to determine if someone is not eligible for the study. ‐ Information Session and Screening Session Information Session and Screening Visit may occur simultaneously or Information Session may occur prior to Screening Visit. Prior to the Screening Visit, potential subjects will be asked to arrive at the CNRC after an overnight‐fast (stop eating after 10 pm) and be well‐hydrated. Subjects should aim for drinking at least 8‐10 cups of water the 24 h prior to the Screening Visit. Information Session: At the CNRC, pre‐screened subjects will participate in an Information Session where they will be informed of all study procedures and study schedules. If willing to adhere to all study procedures and schedules, they will be asked to read, ask questions, signand date the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) before any laboratory or study screening procedures begin. Screening Visit: After meeting eligibility criteria for blood glucose (BG) and blood pressure (BP) measures, subjects will advance to further screening procedures which will include a comprehensive chemistry panel plus TSH, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, body composition), BMI (calculated from height and weight), medical history, prior and concomitant medication, and dietary supplements use, and completion of a series of questionnaires relating to their general health and lifestyle. After confirming eligibility through blood test results, subjects will then be scheduled for a visit to the Illinois Eye Institute (IEI) for a screening eye exam. During this exam, drops to check the eye pressure and drops to dilate eyes will be used. Based on study eligibility criteria subjects may be invited to participate in the study. A Pre‐Study Visit and all Test Day Visits will be scheduled before leaving the CNRC or shortly thereafter. ‐Pre‐Study Visit, Randomization, and Cognitive assessment The pre‐study visit is for training on various aspects of the study. In addition, subjects will be randomized for more specific study protocol information (eg., dietary inclusion of study foods). The Pre‐Study Visit will also include a baseline cognitive function test. This will include visiting instructions for preparing for the cognitive test (eg., fasting instructions, waiting to eat breakfast and having morning coffee/tea at the clinic, etc). Each subject will come to the CNRC in fasting (10 hours) state for one pre‐scheduled Pre‐Study Visit, where they will receive a breakfast meal to consume onsite and complete the baseline cognitive testing and then proceed to instructions on the process for completing various aspects of the research protocol, including but not limited to, the online 24 h dietary recalls (via ASA24 program), weekly visits for food pick up, incorporating foods into diet, plan for eye exams, and more. They will also be provided with all study instructions for fasting before each major test day, completing check‐off diaries to help with study compliance, text/email verification receiving appointment reminders, etc. Test Day Visits: All subjects will report to the CNRC on a weekly basis unless conditions outside our control require less frequent person‐to‐person interaction. In this case, however, alternatives mechanisms will be instituted to ensure contact with subjects and delivery of the product. Visit 1, Visit 5, and Visit 9 will have two phases (a visit at IEI & b visit at CNRC). specifically, subjects will go to the IEI for collection of the OCT‐A images (Visit 1a, 5a, and 9a) 1‐5 days prior to the visit at CNRC. Visits at CNRC: Visit 1b, Visit 5b, and Visit 9b encompass all study procedures (except for the cognitive battery, which is performed at Pre‐Study and Visit 8). A fasting blood sample, FMD, PWV, cBP, anthropometrics, and 24 h recall will all be assessed. Subjects will be given a standardized breakfast and the FMD repeated 1.5 h later. Thereafter, subject will be given groceries and study‐specific food products and reminded how to include in their diet. A Test Day Visit Questionnaire to report compliance with study instructions (after first visit), dietary tolerance and general health status (any illnesses in the 7 days before the Test Day Visit), change in meds, will be given/collected. To minimize vascular and metabolic variability due to hormone fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle women will be studied in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. The 8‐week intervention allows for scheduling individuals' females accordingly. For subjects willing to return 2 months after discontinuing treatment, Visit 9 will be repeated for follow‐up. This visit will not be considered part of ""completer"" analysis but will provide insight for research and study designs.

 Eating an avocado a day does not change body composition or blood cholesterol in healthy students," Johnson, MB;  Burns-Whitmore, B;  Spalding, T;  Sancho-Madriz, MF"," Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Primary risk factors includes high serum cholesterol and high percent body fat composition. Diets high in monounsaturated fats (MUFA) have been shown to improve serum lipid profile without negatively altering body composition. Our study sought to determine if daily ingestion of avocados, a food high in MUFA, elicits the same response in healthy people. Free‐living, healthy male and female students (age 18‐40) completed a parallel design; a four‐week avocado‐free (AF) run‐in followed by a random assignment to one of two eight‐week treatment periods: AF or avocado‐enriched (AE) treatment. Body composition and serum lipid analyses were measured at the beginning and end of each period. Neither treatment produced a change in total, LDL, HDL cholesterols, triacylglycerides, or body composition. The AE group resisted an increase in the non‐HDL:HDL ratio exhibited by the AF treatment. Though improvement in total serum lipid profile wasn't observed, results suggest that an avocado‐enriched diet might reduce cardiovascular disease risk in a healthy population. Additionally, a diet rich in avocado does not contribute to changes in body composition, suggesting that foods high in MUFA do not alter body composition in free‐living, healthy people.",2013,,,27,,, CN-01025520,,,#14052,Johnson 2013,Exclusion reason: Abstract only; ,

 Optimising mealtime insulin bolusing algorithms for dietary fat to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes," ACTRN12617000828325,"," INTERVENTION: Part 1: Relationship Between Amount and Type of Dietary Fat and Postprandial Glycaemia A randomised, within‐subject trial comparing capillary postprandial glycaemia for meals of varying amounts and types of fat over 5h with the same insulin dose for all meals (based on the insulin: CHO ratio) in 20 adults with T1D using insulin pump therapy. Dietary Fat: * 4 amounts of fat (0g, 20g, 40g, 60g) added to 45g CHO * 3 different types of fat (saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat) added to 45g CHO Part 2: Optimal Prandial Insulin Bolusing Strategy for Dietary Fat A randomised, within‐subject trial in the same participants to identify the optimal insulin bolus dose and delivery pattern, using the Model Predicted Bolus, for meals of varying fat content and amount in 20 adults with T1D using insulin pump therapy. * 1 type of fat (Monounsaturated fat) x 3 amounts of fat (20g, 40g, 60g) added to 45g CHO Design Rationale: The types and amounts of fat, for which the ICR did not provide adequate insulin coverage in Part 1 (assessed as blood glucose levels outside target range of 4‐10mmol/L), will then receive the same test meals with a MPB in the same participants (Predicted to be meals B, C and D). Using a previously validated MPB to determine the optimised subcutaneous insulin dose allows us to achieve tight postprandial glycemic control that is directly applicable to the clinical setting. The bolus delivery pattern for the MPB will be derived from the data from Part 1. Model Predicted Bolus (MPB): Our model uses ‘Model Predictive Control’ to identify the acute changes in physiological parameters affected by meal composition and insulin dosing and predicts the optimal insulin bolus amount and pattern to achieve the minimal area above 10 mmol/L and below 4 mmol/L. In simple terms, the known variables (the macronutrient content of the meal, the insulin dose given and resulting blood glucose results) are used to determine individual physiological parameters ( the unknown variable) in Part 1. The model then 'rearranges the formula' to predict the optimal insulin dose (i.e the MPB, unknown variable) for the known individual physiological parameters, meal macronutrient composition and desired blood glucose result. This MPB can then be validated in people with T1D to confirm the efficacy of the prediction. The model has been previously been validated for predicting T1D mealtime insulin in the following paper: Bell KJ, Toschi E, Steil GM, Wolpert HA.

 The impact of avocado fruit on postprandial satiety: an acute dose response study," Huang, Y;  Park, E;  Xiao, D;  Edirisinghe, I;  Burton-Freeman, BM"," Avocado fruit contains a unique combination of monounsaturated fat and dietary fibers. Previous studies have tested the effects of fat or fiber on satiety/appetite control; however data are limited on the interaction of fat and fiber to enhance satiety. The aim of the present study was to characterize the effect of avocados, a fruit naturally high in healthy fat and dietary fiber, on subjective and biological indicators of satiety. Thirty‐one adults who were overweight or obese (body mass index 29.0 ± 2.4 kg/m2, age 37.9 ± 10.3 y, n = 16 female and n = 15 male) participated in this 3‐arm, single‐blinded, cross‐over clinical trial. Participants were provided a low fat high carbohydrate breakfast control meal (CON) or two energy‐matched meals containing either half an avocado (HA, 68 g) or a whole avocado (WA, 136 g) on 3 different occasions at least one week apart. Blood samples were collected at baseline (0 h) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after treatment to assess changes in glucagon‐like peptide‐17‐36 (GLP‐1), peptide YY3‐36 (PYY) and total ghrelin. Visual analog scales (VAS) were used to measure changes in subjective satiety (hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective consumption) and mood variables during the same 6 h time frame. Area under the curve analysis indicated the WA meal increased GLP‐1 by 17% and PYY by 21% compared to the CON meal, p < 0.05, whereas ghrelin was suppressed 25% more after the CON meal compared to WA meal, p < 0.05. Assessment of motivation to eat and mood variables indicated a significant reduction in prospective consumption after the WA and HA meals compared to CON meal, p ≤ 0.05 and increased fullness after WA meal compared to HA (P<0.05), but not compared to CON (p=0.11). The study results indicate that increasing the fat and fiber content of a breakfast meal with avocados compared to an iso‐energetic low fat meal increased feelings of fullness and reduced the amount of food subjects wanted to eat over 6 h. These data are consistent with an elevation in two known satiety peptides (GLP‐1 and PYY) and suggest that avocados may have an important role in helping individuals manage the amount they want to eat between meals and possibly at the next meal.",2017,,,31,1,, CN-01472784,,,#14081,Huang 2017,Exclusion reason: Abstract only; ,
 Effects of Avocado Intake on the Nutritional Status of Families," NCT02903433,"," Avocados are an excellent source of fiber, potassium, magnesium, and poly‐ and mono‐unsaturated fats. They can be a nutrient dense component of healthful dietary patterns and have the potential to improve the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles of families in the United States (US).

Healthy dietary patterns induce changes at the molecular level. Currently, there are no studies evaluating the effect of a diet based on fruit, avocado, whole grains, and trout (FAWGT diet) on the expression of obesity‐related genes. This randomized controlled crossover study included 44 obese Colombians with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 who followed either a FAWGT diet or a usual diet (UD) characterized by a high intake of saturated fat and foods rich in processed carbohydrates. After 8 weeks of intervention, a postprandial expression study of inflammation and oxidative stress‐related genes was carried out with a real‐time PCR. The intervention with a FAWGT diet decreased the expression of inflammatory (NFKB1, IL6, IL1β) and oxidative stress (NFE2L2) genes compared with the intake of the UD. Finally, the postprandial expression of NFkB1 was positively correlated with triglyceride levels after a dietary intervention with the FAWGT diet and the IL1β gene, and likewise with insulin levels after following the usual diet. The consumption of the FAWGT diet for 8 weeks reduced the inflammatory status; thus, it can be considered a valid alternative to other healthy diets, since it induces beneficial changes on the genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress in obese people.",2023,,,15,2,, CN-02518767, 10.3390/nu15020306,,#14097,Munoz-Perez 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,

 Avocado consumption increases neural lutein and improves cognitive function," Johnson, E;  Vishwanathan, R;  Mohn, E;  Haddock, J;  Rasmussen, H;  Scott, T"," Lutein, a dietary carotenoid, is selectively taken up into primate neural tissue such as the macula and brain. Lutein levels in serum, macula (macular pigment, MP) and brain are related to better cognition. MP is a biomarker of lutein levels in brain. Avocados are a highly bioavailable source of lutein. This 6 mo randomized, controlled trial tested the effects of daily intake of 1 medium avocado (AV, n=19) vs 1 medium potato or 1 cup of chickpeas (C, n=20) on serum lutein levels, MP density and cognition in healthy older adults (>50 yrs). Serum carotenoids were measured by HPLC. MP density, using heterochromatic flicker photometry, was used as a measure of lutein in neural tissue. A computerized cognitive assessment battery was used for cognition measures (CANTAB). At baseline there were no significant differences between the AV and C in any of the study measures. At 6 mo, serum lutein levels in the AV group significantly increased from baseline by 20% (34.7+11.2 to 41.8+14.3 pmol/dL, p <0.0005) whereas the C group increased by 7% (34.8+17.3 to 37.1+16.3 pmol/dL, p <0.03). At 6 mo there was a significant increase in MP density in the AV group (0.396+0.141 to 0.481+0.123 OD, p <0.001). MP density did not change from baseline in the C group (0.385+0.166 vs 0.424+0.145 OD). In the AV group the change in MP density was significantly related to an improved spatial working memory (p <0.009) and problem approaching efficiency (p <0.036). No significant changes in cognitive function were observed in the C group. These data suggest that an intervention with avocados to increase neural lutein is an effective dietary strategy for cognitive health.",2015,,,29,1,, CN-01071467,,,#14110,Johnson 2015,Exclusion reason: Abstract only; ,
 Nutrient composition of discarded gastric residuals in extremely preterm infants in a probiotic trial," Gayatri, A-J;  Megan, N;  Ching-Tat, L;  Elizabeth, N;  Donna, G;  Karen, S;  Sanjay, P"," Background: Coloured, especially dark green gastric residuals (GR) are often considered as a sign of feed intolerance and discarded in preterm infants. Probiotics enhance gut motility and feed tolerance in preterm infants Aim: Compare nutrient composition of GRs in extremely preterm (EP) infants in a probiotic trial. Methods: Discarded light (lime, wasabi) and dark green (spinach, avocado) GRs from EP infants (<28 weeks) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT; 'SiMPro') of single vs three‐strain probiotic were collected in first two weeks of life for assessing nutrient (nitrogen, carbohydrate, fat) composition and other outcomes including time to full feeds (TFF: 150 ml/kg/day). EP infants receiving placebo in the RCT of single‐strain probiotic (PANTS) served as a reference group. Linear regression modelling with clustered standard errors for repeated measurements was used. Results: (1) Nutrient composition: 74/103 GRs from 39 SiMPro infants (21: single‐strain, 18: three‐strain) had adequate volume for analysis: Mean nitrogen and carbohydrate content was comparable between light vs dark green GRs. Mean fat content was higher in avocado vs spinach (17.52 g/l vs 9.69 g/l, P = 0.036) but similar between spinach and light green GRs (14.02 g/l, P = 0.364) and between single vs. threestrain infants. (2) GRs: Compared with PANTS (N = 29), SiMPro infants (N = 79 vs 75) had shorter median TFF (10 vs 14 days, P = 0.02), TPN duration (10 vs 16 days, P = 0.022), higher feed volumes (54.8 vs 22.7 ml, P < 0.001), and less frequent haemorrhagic residuals (32.9% vs. 89.7%, P < 0.001).

 Nutritional Intervention May Change Physical Activity Levels in Latino Families: a Cluster Randomized Control Trial," Shrout, TA;  King, C;  Denenberg, J;  Eastman, A;  Allison, MA"," Introduction: Nutrition and physical activity (PA) are key components for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. There remains a paucity of longitudinal data on the role of specific nutritional interventions and how they may impact PA levels, particularly in Latino populations.Hypothesis: We hypothesized that high allocation of avocados in Latino families would result in higher PA levels, measured as metabolic equivalent minutes per week (MET‐min/wk) . Methods: A total of 72 Latino families (235 participants, 150 women) in San Diego, CA, were randomized to low‐ or high‐avocado allocation (3/family/wk or 14/family/wk, respectively). A 14‐day run‐in period was utilized to demonstrate adherence. MET‐min/wk PA measures (total, occupational, recreational, transportation) were assessed at baseline, 3‐months, and 6‐months via the validated global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) (moderate PA, 4 METs; vigorous PA, 8 METs). Using ANCOVA, we compared mean differences in longitudinal PA measures. Results: Randomization assigned 35 families to high‐allocation (0% attrition throughout) and 37 to low‐allocation (8% attrition at 3 months, 16% attrition at 6‐months) with no significant difference in baseline PA. While mean total PA in the low‐allocation group declined over the 6‐month trial period, the inverse appeared true for the high‐allocation group (Figure). Compared to low‐allocation, the mean total PA between baseline to 6‐months was 2,154.75 MET‐min/wk higher in the high‐allocation group (p=0.001), and specifically that of moderate and vigorous occupational PA being 979.25 and 898.17 MET‐min/wk higher in the high‐allocation group (p=0.003 and 0.037), respectively. No significant differences were found for recreational or transportation PA.Meaning: In this trial, and compared with a lower allocation, higher allocation of avocados was associated with significant increases in longitudinal PA measures.

 Product Development of Rehydration Milk Drinks for Athletes after Exercise (Organoleptic Assessment and Nutritional Content)," Hizni, A;  Samuel, S;  Sholichin, S"," BACKGROUND: Lack of drinking causes dehydration. Dehydration conditions affect the muscle performance, muscle endurance, and muscle strength of athletes. AIM: The aim of the study was to study the organoleptic assessment of rehydration milk drink for athletes after exercise. METHODS: This was an experimental research design using completely randomized design. The beverage formulation consists of an avocado rehydration milk drink (ARMD), a guava rehydration milk drink (GRMD), and a guava and ARMD (GARMD). The organoleptic evaluation was carried out by athletes with a preference scale (hedonic) from 1 (very dislike) to 10 (very like) for color, odor, taste, texture, and overall. RESULTS: The organoleptic assessment of all parameters showed no differences between the variants of each treatment (p > 0.05). The highest mean values for all organoleptic parameters for each treatment were ARMD1 (mean value 7.16), GRMD1 (mean value 8.03), and GARMD1 (mean value 6.86). The overall mean value is determined to be the best product of each treatment. Of the three treatments, GRMD1 had a better overall organoleptic mean score compared to ARMD1 and GARMD1.

Anthropometrics (height, weight and waist circumference), body composition, ear temperature, and vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be measured. For women under the age of 60 years, a pregnancy test will be conducted. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated from height and weight measurements. Fasting blood glucose level by capillary blood from finger prick will be tested. For vital sign measurements, subjects will sit in a comfortable chair, feet uncrossed and on the floor and will be asked to rest quietly for 5 minutes before measuring blood pressure and heart rate. Arm vein will be assessed using a vein access scale test. Subject will be instructed to complete a 24‐hour food recall. Based on the results of the questionnaires, BMI calculation, and health evaluation, subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. Eligible subjects will be trained and instructed to record all food and beverages consumed for a 24 hour period on food record diarie using ASA24. Subjects will be asked not to take any allergy medications and/or any pain medications such as Aspirin, Excedrin, Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin), Naproxen, or Aleve within 48 hours of each scheduled study days. Tylenol is allowed. If they need to take allergy/pain medication 48 hours prior to their study day, we will ask them to let the study investigators know so they can be rescheduled. Before leaving the CNRC, subjects will be provided with written instruction for ""how to prepare for your study visit"". This will include instructions for eating a standardized dinner meal the night before the study day, consume the assigned study snacks, fasting overnight (10‐12 hours), avoidance of vigorous physical activity, alcoholic and caffeinated beverage consumption for at least 24 hours preceding a study day, maintain regular sleep pattern and usual diet except for the guidance provided for ""foods and beverages to avoid or limit"". If subject did not get enough sleep during the night preceding a study day, we will ask them to let us know so we can reschedule their study day. STUDY DAYS: Participation in this study will last approximately 2 to 3 weeks and include 3 Study Day visits to the CNRC. Each Study Day visit will last about 3.5 hours. The day before each of the Study Day visits, subjects will be asked to come to the Center to pick up a dinner meal and evening snack and will be asked to consume only the provided dinner meal and snacks the evening before the visit. Subject will be provided with guidance on how to maintain the same dinner intake, and when to consume the snacks (12 hour before the scheduled study visit time, schedule based on the subject's typical evening snack and morning breakfast routine) At each Study Day visit, subjects will arrive at the clinic after fasting for 10 to 12 hours and in a well‐hydrated and well‐rested state after regular sleep the night before. If they are taking medication(s) each morning, they will be asked not to take the medication(s) at home and instead to bring to the CNRC to be taken in the presence of the study investigator so the medications(s) is taken at the same time before each Study Day visit. Study protocol adherence will be corroborated by asking about the period of fasted state. Subject will also be asked about their detailed food intake the 24‐hour period prior to the visit to ensure consistency and compliance with the protocol requirements. Subjects experiencing unusual stressful events (such as loss of job, loss of loved one, divorce, etc...) or having active infection will be rescheduled to a later time agreed upon by the subject and investigator. Participants having experienced active infection can be rescheduled when symptoms have been gone for at least 5 days and been off treatment (ex. Antibiotics) for same time duration. The test period will be extended for study completion in these cases. Subject will be asked about their medication intake and health status since their last visit to ensure that subjects are maintaining their good health and medication intake. After confirming compliance with the protocol, anthropometric measurements, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and ear temperature) will be taken. A finge prick for fasting blood glucose will be taken to confirm if the subject is fasting. A licensed healthcare professional (LHCP) will evaluate and place a catheter on the antecubital site of the subject's non‐dominant arm or arm of preference by subject. A catheter is a thin flexible tube that allows sampling of blood through one port throughout the Study Day. Once the catheter is placed, a blood sample will be taken (Time point T 0). After completing baseline blood sampling, subjects will receive a standard meal with a minimum of 50 g available carbohydrate to consume within 10 minutes. After the test food is consumed, additional blood samples will be taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 minutes after the start of breakfast consumption. Subjects are allowed to drink water and the amount will be recorded. After completion of all study procedures and data/sample collection for the day, the catheter will be removed and subjects will be evaluated for safety and/or discomfort/symptoms before leaving the study site. They will be given a snack and written instructions in preparation for the next visit. Study day visits will be scheduled at least 3 days apart. Study Day 2 and 3 will be exactly the same as Study Day 1 except the evening snacks to consume before each Study Day. Blood collection: Blood will be collected a total of 7 times on each Study Day visit and 4 mL of the blood sample will be collected at each time point at each Study Day visit. Over the course of the whole study, the total amount of blood collected will be 84 mL, which is less than what is allowed for a one‐time blood donation ( 550 mL). Adverse Events (AEs) will be assessed throughout Study Day visit. In an emergency while the study subject is at CNRC, a LHCP will be on site to monitor the subject. In the unlikely event of a medical emergency, 911 and emergency response will be called to the site. The adverse event will be documented, determined as treatment‐related or non‐treatment related by the Investigator and submitted to the IRB within 3 days or sooner for treatment related adverse events. Serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported within 24 hours of our knowledge of the SAE. A copy will be filed in the subject's study chart. Study staffs are also trained and certified in CPR techniques. In the event of an after‐hours emergency, subject will be advised to obtain medical attention as appropriate for the described symptoms. The subject is not required to contact the Investigator prior to seeking medical attention, however will be required to report the adverse event to the study manager or study coordinator at the next scheduled contact or sooner if appropriate. Retention and Compliance: This study will include periodic telephone reminder calls along with in‐person contact for study day visits. Phone calls will be made to remind subjects to record food intake (according to the subject specific pre‐determined food record schedule), maintain consistency in their overall diet and exercise habit prior to the Study Day visit and to confirm visit schedules.",2022,,,,,, CN-02382107,,,#14146,NCT05263011 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong article type; ,

" The effect of prolonged dietary exposure and the association between taste receptor expression, fatty acid taste sensitivity and satiety in healthy weight participants"," ACTRN12612000881831,"," INTERVENTION: Subjects will participate in a crossover dietary intervention, involving consumption of both a high and low fat diet for a period of 10 weeks each, with a two week wash out period. The high fat diet will consist of 40% fat while participants on the low fat diet will be asked to consume <20% fat. To account for differences in energy needs, all diets will be customised to each participant. For the high fat diet, participants will be provided with a number of high fat foods (i.e. full cream milk, cooking oil, butter, cheese, chocolate bars, nuts, avocado, muffins etc) on a weekly basis and will be supplied with an information sheet detailing which foods to consume and how many portions of each (i.e. 250g toasted muesli and 1 chocolate bar). Participants on the low fat diet will be instructed to limit their dietary fat consumption to <20% total energy. Participants will be provided with nutritional advice and an information package to assist with compliance of the diet. Participants will be asked to swap high fat foods for low fat alternatives (e.g. full‐fat dairy for low fat dairy and high fat salad dressing for low fat salad dressing) and discontinue the use of oil, butter and other cooking fats. Participants will also be asked not to consume other sources of fats including nuts, avocado, take away food (pizza, burgers, hot chips), processed meat or meat with visible fat or snack foods such as chocolate or potato chips. The diet will also supplemented with additional foods such as low fat, portion controlled meals which the participant will be allowed to consume for either lunch or dinner. A low fat recipe booklet will also be provided to assist with food preparation. To assess dietary adherence, weekly 24‐hour food records will be completed. A number of measures will also be taken prior to, during and following the intervention to evaluate the effect of dietary fat intake on fatty acid taste sensitivity, taste receptor expression and corresponding satiety responses. CONDITION: Overweight and obesity SECONDARY OUTCOME: Nil INCLUSION CRITERIA: ‐ Adults >18 years of age ‐ Healthy weight individuals (BMI <25) ‐ Adults living in Melbourne ‐ Adults with good written and spoken English ‐ Adults who are able to attend Deakin University, Burwood and complete testing sessions between the hours of 9‐6pm Monday‐Friday In one session, fatty acid taste sensitivity will be measured using milk samples with added oleic acid (and control samples with no added oleic acid) using a three‐alternate forced choice sensory procedure. Putative fatty acid taste receptor expression (GPR120, GPR40 and CD36) will be measured by collecting a microgram quantity of taste cells in saliva samples. The procedure will involve participants running their teeth along the front of the tongue (fungiform papillae) with sufficient pressure and will be asked to expectorate into a tube until approximately 1mL of saliva is collected. RNA level will be measured using real time PCR techniques. Participants will also perform a fat ranking task using custard samples varying in fat percentage (0, 2, 6 and 10%) to assess fat perception and rate liking of various high and low fat foods. Height, weight, hip and waist circumference will be measured. Within 7 days, participants will be provided with, and asked to consume a standardised breakfast (approximately 1200kJ consisting of cereal, milk, yoghurt, fruit and tea/coffee) on the morning of testing. Participants will rate appetite, prospective food consumption and hunger perceptions on a 100mm visual analogue scale before and after consumption of the breakfast. Three hours later, participants will return to the sensory laboratory where food consumption will be measured. Participants will be presented with a buffet style lunch, with foods presented in excess (10,000kJ) and asked to eat until comfortably full. The amount of food consumed will be calculated by weighing the meal prior to, and following consumption (in grams). Energy intake will also be calculated.

The information provided included the importance of exercise and motivational messages to exercise more at home or in the gym. Participants were informed of previous study results which showed that 8‐12 weeks of exercise can ameliorate cardiovascular risk factors and improve mental health. The second part of the educational service was about the importance of decreasing the stress levels. The participants were informed that markers of oxidative stress were found to be out of range in PCOS women and that it was proven beneficial to do breathing exercises to reduce stress. It was clarified that the breathing exercise does not only relieve stress but also may help to gain better sleep and relieve anxiety symptoms. Participants were informed to perform a simple breathing exercise on daily basis (twice a day, morning and night) where they inhale through the nose for the account of four, and then exhale through the nose for the count of four, with the possibility to increase the counting to 6 then to 8. The third part of the educational service aimed at improving participants' diets. They were informed to follow specific diet recommendations as follows: to consume the majority of their daily calories prior to 12 pm (shown to improve insulin and glucose levels and decrease testosterone levels), to focus on food with low glycemic load e.g. chicken, meat, eggs and avocado (shown to decrease insulin levels). to increase their vitamin C and calcium intake e.g. kiwi, orange and lemons (shown to improve body mass index and menstrual abnormalities, along with other PCOS‐related symptoms). to include adequate magnesium intake in their diet e.g. legume, spinach, broccoli, banana and pineapple (shown to lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke). to increase chromium intake, found in onions, garlic, grapefruit and tomatoes (shown to help regulate insulin and glucose levels). to increase their consumption of omega‐3, found in food such as tuna, salmon, fish, and walnuts (shown to help in decreasing androgen levels and testosterone). In addition, participants were informed to avoid or to minimize certain types of food, explaining to them how it may negatively affect their PCOS condition. Such food types included caffeine beverages (as it may increase the estrogen level and affect fertility). hydrogenated oils including margarine, corn oil, and coffee creamers (as it decreases the HDL (the good cholesterol), and increases the LDL (the bad cholesterol). white sugary foods like cookies, cakes, and candies (as it can increase glucose levels). dairy products (since it can cause allergic reactions and digestion problems, in addition to raising the testosterone levels). Processed food (because it has a negative effect on insulin level). PCOS treatment was also discussed (orally only) with the participants (Fourth part of the service). Females were advised on the importance of using their correct treatment, for example using the pill for hormonal balance. They were informed of the importance of adhering to their prescribed medications, accepting that it was a long term treatment plan, and to consult with their specialist if their treatment was not effective, or in the case of medication side effects.",2020,,,,,, CN-02125220,,,#14168,NCT04416620 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong study type; ,

Habitual/Western (Western) diet, containing 500 kcal/day from non‐Mediterranean target foods (such as potato, beef, sour cream, refined grain bread, chocolate dessert); among individuals who are not already consuming a Mediterranean‐style dietary pattern. Participants will have overweight or obesity and meet criteria for Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), and therefore be at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease (CMD). The primary goal is to validate results from metabolomics analyses of foods and biospecimens from a completed Mediterranean‐style dietary intervention in a prospective feeding trial. Secondary aims are to evaluate impacts of incremental changes in diet on cardiometabolic health and microbiome structure/function. The primary hypothesis is that pre‐defined metabolomics signatures in participant biospecimens will be responsive to dietary intakes and reproducible within individuals over time. The secondary hypotheses are that a Mediterranean‐amplified diet will lead to improvements in cardiometabolic health and changes in microbiome structure/function over time and compared to a habitual Western diet. Aim 1: Test reproducibility of pre‐defined signatures from Mediterranean target foods provided in mini‐MED in biospecimens (blood/urine) within individuals over time. Participants will complete a 16‐week randomized cross‐over dietary intervention of mini‐MED vs Western diet. The investigators hypothesize that: (1) novel food‐specific compounds will increase in participant biospecimens after consumption of mini‐MED and decrease during Western diet, and (2) established biomarkers of fruit/vegetable intake (e.g., plasma and skin carotenoids, urine polyphenols) and other target foods (e.g., plasma alkylresorcinols, astaxanthin) will increase after consumption of mini‐MED. Aim 2: Determine the impact of mini‐MED on cardiometabolic health. Cardiometabolic health indicators (e.g., blood pressure, lipid panel, inflammatory cytokines, indicators of subclinical inflammation) will be assessed pre‐ and post‐ each intervention. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of mini‐MED will lead to improvements in cardiometabolic health indicators (e.g., reductions in blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, C‐reactive protein, bioactive lipids; increases in HDL cholesterol) over time and compared to Western diet. Aim 3: Evaluate changes in microbiota community structure/function in response to mini‐MED. Microbiome structure (taxonomy) and function (metagenomics) will be assessed pre‐ and post‐ each intervention. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of mini‐MED will lead to increases in microbiome diversity and enrichment in taxa associated with increased production of health‐promoting compounds (e.g., short chain fatty acids) over time and compared to Western diet.",2022,,,,,, CN-02456575,,,#14181,NCT05500976 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study type; ,
 Healthy carbohydrates or healthy fats following an acute coronary event?," ACTRN12620000689976,"," INTERVENTION: Three arm trial with interventions of twelve weeks duration. The control arm is the provision of usual care following a coronary event, including both pharmacological intervention and lifestyle advice (usual care arm). The usual care for all trial participants will be delivered by the cardiovascular outpatient clinics available to all people following an acute coronary event in New Zealand. One active intervention is the provision of usual care and a weekly delivery of high fibre carbohydrate foods (healthy carbs arm). Tinned legumes, wholegrain foods, vegetables, and whole fruit will be delivered in sufficient amounts to feed the participant and those they live with. The purpose of the intervention is to provide sufficient quantity and choice that participants may choose from within the foods to suit their preferences. The second active intervention is the provision of usual care and the weekly delivery of foods high in healthy fats (healthy fats arm). Foods will be delivered to participant households though online supermarket grocery orders. Vegetable oil, margarine, tinned oily fish, nuts, seeds, and avocado will be delivered in sufficient amounts to feed the participant and those they live with. The purpose of the intervention is to provide sufficient quantity and choice that participants may choose from within the foods to suit their preferences. All participants will be required to use an online portal to enter demographic data, and attend pathology labs for body weight measurement and blood draw.

 Effect of an Antiinflammatory Diet on Postprandial Gene Expression of Mononuclear Cells of Adult Obese Women," NCT04920409,"," A randomized controlled crossover study was conducted. Volunteers underwent to two dietary models for 8 weeks each, including a 2 weeks washout diet between them. The order in which they started the interventions was randomized following a computerized assignment list using Excel software (Microsoft Office 2015, Excel 2013). The primary endpoint was the postprandial gene expression of nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) gene. Based on previous studies , 20 individuals had to be studied to detect a 0.2 difference in the expression of the NKKB1 gene between diets with 0.05 significance level and 80 percentage power (type II error Z 0.2), assuming a 10 percentage drop‐out rate. The recruitment of participants was carried out according to the following steps: 1. Review of clinical histories of patients diagnosed with obesity, according to their Body Mass Index, ascribed to the chronic non‐communicable diseases program of the Clinica Comfamiliar Risaralda in the city of Pereira Colombia. 2. Telephone call to invite the participants who met the inclusion criteria to participate in the study. 3. Appointment prior to the start of the study to take a blood sample to corroborate the inclusion criteria. With this sample the following tests were performed: blood glucose, lipid profile, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), C‐reactive protein ( and complete blood count. This process was carried out by personnel not involved in the research. The results obtained were compared with the clinical history. The diets followed during the intervention periods were: (1) a diet consisting mainly of the consumption of fruit, avocado and other vegetables, whole grains and trout typical of the colombian coffee region (FAWGT) (experimental diet), and (2) the usual diet consumed by the participants in their normal lifestyle (UD). At the beginning of the dietary intervention period, each participant was given an individualized food guide containing the suggested food group and portions, with a wide variety of foods allowed for greater adherence to the diet. In addition, specific times for consumption of the foods and precise instructions for the dietary intervention were given. In addition, the subjects were given a talk advising them how to quantify the portions, which would later be converted into grams according to the procedure described The food portions were standardized with all the participants using synthetic models, adapted according to the Colombian nutritional guidelines, so that they could provide a more accurate report of the portions consumed during the intervention. In addition, a postprandial studies were carried out at the beginning of the study (pre‐intervention) and another after 8 weeks of dietary intervention (post‐intervention). The participants were given an appointment at the health center at 7.00 am, after at least 12 hours of fasting and a 5 day abstinence from alcohol. They consumed a breakfast based on the same composition of the diet in which they were randomized for the dietary intervention period. The blood samples were obtained by veni‐puncture at baseline and 4 hours after breakfast. During the postprandial period, the participants did not consume any more food, although they were allowed to drink water. The breakfasts were composed of the following foods: FAWGT diet; whole‐grain arepa (with unrefined corn flour), cheese, oats, granadilla, mango, linseed, nuts, almonds, peanuts and yogurt. Usual diet; egg, cheese, butter, whole milk, traditional white arepa (with re‐fined corn flour), traditional buñuelo (made from wheat flour with cheese), coffee and sugar. Before starting the dietary intervention period (Pre‐intervention), at the midpoint of the study (week 4) and at the end (week 8), all the participants completed three 24‐hour recalls (2 non‐consecutive weekdays and one weekend day) to obtain information about food, ingredients and preparations consumed in the same units of measurement (grams). In addition, a weekly telephone call was made to answer any questions relating to the diet (recipes, menu and quantities) and to motivate adherence to the assigned dietary model. Moreover, in week four of each intervention, the participants attended the hospital for an interview with the main researcher in order to take anthropometric measurements, evaluate the follow‐up of the dietary instructions and answer any questions that may have arisen during the intervention, and motivate them to continue with the study. To collect the information on food consumption, formats and questionnaires previously published by the research group were used.",2021,,,,,, CN-02289660,,,#14186,NCT04920409 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study type; ,

 MI-CBT Adherence Program for Lifestyle Interventions in Older Adults," NCT04817176,"," Preparation. During the first 6 months of the study, the investigators will work closely with key stakeholders (i.e., clinic director, practice manager, and nurse practitioner) in the Florida State University (FSU) SeniorHealth clinic to coordinate initial contact with patients about the study. Initial contact will include posting flyers in the SeniorHealth clinic, handing out flyers during appointments, and emailing flyers or calling patients who have consented to be contacted about FSU research studies (a consent process, which is completed as part of the normal SeniorHealth intake packet), posting flyers in the Westminster Oaks monthly newsletter, and patients will be able to fill out a contact card with their name, phone number, and email that will be placed in a locked ""drop box"" in the SeniorHealth clinic. A study team member will collect these cards weekly to enter into a secure screening waitlist. Patients may also discuss interest with their provider or contact the study team directly using the information on the study flyer, potential participants will be added to a secure screening waitlist, which will include only their name and phone number. This screening waitlist potential participant contact information will be stored in a password protected document. Contact information for potential participants will be destroyed for any participant who does not qualify and consent to remain in the study. Screening phone call. After confirming interest in being contacted about the study, participants will be contacted by a member of the research team and screened for eligibility. This screening will include a telephone Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), sections 1 and 4 from the Functional Status Questionnaire (FSQ), a brief memory complaint scale, and self‐reported height, weight, and age. Participants will also be asked to report any restrictive dietary or medical conditions that may make them unable to change their nutrition. This contact information will not be retained for future research purposes. All screened participants will be provided with a handout on healthy living designed in collaboration with the SeniorHealth physicians. If participants are eligible, then they will be sent an online consent form, which they will read and review telephonically with a member of the research team before signing. The study team will then complete a final eligibility check of the patient's EHR and review with the physician to confirm eligibility and ensure participant safety. Participants who are eligible and consent to participate will have screening data linked with other study data, in order to reduce redundancy in assessment measures. Pre‐intervention EHR data download (Time 0). The research team will extract and clean relevant EHR data on participants who consent to participate in the study. Data from EHR will be used to conduct a secondary eligibility screening to determine if there are any other major health conditions that will exclude participants from the study. Data will only include the minimum protected health information (PHI) necessary to complete the proposed study. Data from the EHR will include the following information only from appointments pertinent to the study: patients' problem/diagnostic list, medication list, patient vitals, metabolic panels, HbA1C, scores on recent cognitive and psychological assessments (i.e., MoCA, depression inventories), and relevant provider notes about a patient's cognitive functioning. Participants that are seen by FSU clinicians will be considered for the study and contacted by our team. Their EHR is maintained on Athena and thus all the information will be accessed from Athena. Clinic staff working for FSU will be responsible for screening their EHR and determining their eligibility for the study. These data will include the participants MoCA scores, the geriatric depression inventory (GDS), and FSQ scores or relevant qualitative data about their activities of daily living, and demographic characteristics. The study team will also include laboratory results that may be relevant to cognitive outcomes for secondary data analyses, including: HbA1c, glucose, potassium, blood pressure, and cholesterol. All laboratory data will be pulled from the EHR, and will not require additional bloodwork or labs to be completed by patient participants. Baseline Assessment (Time 1). In addition to embedded EHR data, we are collecting additional data to evaluate the personal impacts of the intervention. This assessment will include: the Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS update ‐ form A), the GDS, FSQ, and CAIDE risk score. This assessment will be completed using HIPAA Compliant Zoom. Post‐intervention Assessment (Time 2). Participants will complete this assessment in the final weeks of the program, in order to assess participants when they are in ketosis. Participants will be asked to return their ketone logs either electronically, reported over the phone, or via mail to the study PI. The research team will complete qualitative interviews with participants to collect information about barriers and facilitators to completing the program and adhering to KN. Participants will complete the RBANS update ‐ Form B, the GDS, and FSQ, and the client satisfaction questionnaire . This assessment will be completed using HIPAA Compliant Zoom. Post‐intervention EHR data download and Provider Assessment (Time 3). Approximately six months post‐intervention, we will complete a final data extraction from the EHR, which will include the same data as Time 0. Additionally, we will complete semi‐structured interviews with the clinic providers to assess implementation barriers and facilitators. Providers will also complete quantitative measures on implementation acceptability (i.e., Modified version of the Assessment of Fit Scale for outpatient clinics). Post‐intervention Assessment (Time 4). Patient participants will complete this assessment approximately 3 months after completing the intervention program, in order to assess long‐term maintenance. The research team will complete qualitative interviews with participants to collect information about barriers and facilitators to adhering to KN long‐term. Participants will complete the RBANS Update ‐ form C, the GDS, and FSQ. This assessment will be completed using HIPAA Compliant Zoom. Intervention Description: Using a centralized telehealth approach, the KNA program will consist of 6 weekly group meetings, which will take place via HIPAA‐compliant Zoom. The group will be co‐led by a clinical psychologist and a licensed nutritionist. Approximately half of each session will be devoted to providing nutrition information and half devoted to psychoeducation, MI activities, and CBT skills. Each group session will be recorded and rated by a trained clinician using a modified MI Coach Rating Scale to measure fidelity to MI‐CBT strategies and reviewed with a recognized expert on MI and CBT. These recordings will be stored on a secure College of Medicine network drive and will only be used for the duration of the project and reviewed by the study team for quality control and intervention consistency. Any information from these recordings used for research purposes will be fully de‐identified, with qualitative information transcribed and coded by the research team. MI‐CBT KNA Week 1: The first group meeting will consist of a 1.5 hour informational and psychoeducational session to introduce participants to the purpose of the group, the ketogenic nutrition goals, and to the MI‐CBT model of behavior change in relation to nutrition. Participants will be mailed a workbook that includes weekly goals, handouts on how to maintain KN, including daily recipes and food lists, as well as MI‐CBT handouts and worksheets. Participants will be asked to slowly begin reducing daily net carbohydrate intake to 125g over the first week. The study team will provide individualized recommendations for macronutrient intake based on the net carbohydrate weekly goal and participant health information (e.g., sex, weight, height, activity level). Participants will log macronutrient intake in their food logs in order to ensure that approximately 60% of their diet involves healthy fats (e.g., fish, avocado, olive oils), and to begin learning the general macronutrient content of foods they consume. Participants will have the option of completing these food longs online or using paper copies at home. The focus of these first meetings will be on nutritional education and helping participants identify relevant values, goals, and reasons for committing to make healthy changes. MI‐CBT KNA Weeks 2‐4: In 1‐hour weekly meetings, participants will learn about the CBT model and relevant skills, with assigned homework. Based on feedback from the feasibility trial, the program will emphasize cognitive restructuring and problem‐solving as primary skills, while handouts on additional techniques (e.g., distress tolerance, behavioral activation, mindfulness) will be provided as optional. These skills will help participants identify health goals, manage triggers for unhealthy eating behaviors, and overcome external obstacles to healthy eating. MI will be employed throughout these sessions, through worksheets as well as reflective listening, summarizing, affirming, and open‐ended questions from the group leaders. Participants will be instructed to gradually reduce their net carbohydrate intake across the first 3 weeks of the program in a step‐wise fashion (i.e., 125g in week 1, 75g in week 2, 50g or less in week 3) in order to reduce possible adverse responses to the diet (e.g., GI distress, fatigue). Healthy fat intake is a core component of this program, and participants will be provided with ample instruction on ways to increase healthy fat intake while maintaining a healthy balance of macronutrients (e.g., 60% fat, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrates). MI‐CBT KNA Weeks 5‐6: In the final two sessions, the focus will shift to emphasize CBT skills practice, maintenance of goals, sustainment of progress, and social support. Participants will make maintenance plans, learn to manage slips, and continue practicing cognitive restructuring skills. The recommended net carbohydrate intake will be reduced to 20g or less these weeks, depending on individual ketone level and macronutrients. KN‐Only (Condition 2): Participants assigned to the KN‐only group will attend a 1.5‐hour informational session as a group, which will provide comprehensive information about how to adhere to KN and how to track macronutrients, food intake, and ketone levels. Participants will be provided with the same participant workbook as the MI‐CBT KNA group with informational handouts and KN recipes, but without the MI‐CBT handouts. Participants will be asked to track food intake and daily ketone levels, and will be provided with the option of attending a weekly Zoom meeting where they may ask questions about KN and receive additional nutrition information as needed. These optional meetings will be offered for 6 weeks. The structure of this control condition will allow us to examine of the benefits that an MI‐CBT group approach provides for increasing adherence to KN and retention in a KN program, compared to KN education only.",2021,,,,,, CN-02253211,,,#14188,NCT04817176 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study type; ,
 Effectiveness of Curcumin-based Food Supplement in Reducing Pain and Inflammatory Component in Osteoarthritis," NCT04207021,"," INTRODUCTION Gonarthrosis is the most common disorder of the musculoskeletal system, with an age‐related prevalence varying between 12‐55%. The treatment of OA is mostly symptomatic and includes the use of analgesics, NSAIDs, exercise and even surgery. However, the use of long‐term NSAIDs is associated with potentially serious side effects, with a high risk of hospitalization and death. As a result, the use of alternative and complementary therapies (CAM), such as nutritional therapies in patients with OA, is extremely frequent. The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a dietary supplement based on curcumin, polydatin and beta‐caryophyllene (FENOXIDOL™‐Mivell), on the reduction of pain and inflammatory component in individuals with knee OA. MATERIAL AND METHOD Study design Intervention study with two parallel arms, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled to assess the effectiveness of the dietary supplement in reducing perceived pain, will also be evaluated secondarily the improvement of joint function, changes in serum levels of PCR, inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐alpha and IL‐6) and nitrates / nitrites at the level of saliva and any change in the use of painkillers when needed. Intervention Intervention group: the study involves the intake of two capsules per day, one capsule to be taken before breakfast and one before dinner for a period of 6 weeks. The FENOXIDOL™ supplement and its placebo (visually identical capsules, but without active ingredients) will be supplied by the company Mivell Srls participating in the PrIntAge project. For the composition of the placebo, see the declaration attached to this document by Mivell Srls. FENOXIDOL™ is a natural anti‐inflammatory supplement designed to counteract, without any known side effects, acute and chronic inflammatory phenomena, especially those associated with joints, muscles and bones. The product has been formulated using naturally derived extracts in the quantities shown in the table below. PHENOXIDOL CAPSULE COMPOSITION active substances for 1 capsule for 2 capsules Bio Curcumin 200 mg 400 mg Polydatin 50 mg 100 mg Beta‐Caryophyllene 24 mg 48 mg It should be noted that the product FENOXIDOL™ and its components have not been associated to date with any side effects, the active ingredients of the formula are all listed in Annex 1 of the Italian Ministry Decree of 10 August 2018 governing the use in food supplements of herbal substances and preparations as updated by Decree 9 January 2019. It should also be noted that the FENOXIDOL™ product has no Gluten Free certification. Placebo group: the study involves taking two capsules per day of placebo, one capsule before breakfast and one before dinner for a period of 6 weeks. The placebo will consist of capsules with no active ingredients containing cellulose, fatty acid magnesium salts, and silicon dioxide. All participants will be allowed to use anti‐inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen up to 400 mg per 2/day) to control pain, if needed. The patient will, however, be required to avoid / suspend the use of anti‐inflammatory at least 12 hours before the visit to baseline and subsequent checkups and to record the use. The patient's compliance with the treatment will be calculated on the basis of the percentage of residual doses at the end of the study and on the basis of the compilation of a diary. The volume of blood collected will be 5 ml, as part of the blood sample performed for chemical and clinical tests provided for in normal clinical practice. Blood sample testing will be performed immediately after collection at GSS Laboratories, using standard methods. In addition ‐ Before enrolment, all potentially eligible patients should receive full information about the study; Treatment, randomisation and blinding kits Mivell Srls will prepare patient kits containing treatment capsules in proportion to the time of administration and sample size considered and will send them by courier to the Pharmacy of the Istituto di Riabilitazione Santo Stefano. In order to carry out the double‐blind study, these kits will be assigned, by Mivell Srls, identification codes based on the randomization lists generated by a statistical software. Blinding will be maintained for the entire duration of the study, until the analysis of the data and, possibly, interrupted only at the time of highlighting potential adverse winds in the participants. Biological samples and data collection Data will be collected on age, gender, educational level, BMI, employment, physical activity at work and in leisure time (IPAQ Questionnaire), tobacco habits, presence of comorbidity, type of diet (food frequency questionnaire related to the last week, with particular regard to the intake of substances with anti‐inflammatory / antioxidant power, eg: seeds and dried fruit, dark chocolate, bananas, avocado, soya products, leafy vegetables, fish, garlic, curry, rosemary, ginger, saffron, (see Cavicchia, 2009), use of drugs (with particular regard to the frequency of taking painkillers and anti‐inflammatory drugs in the previous six weeks) and supplements. The following will also be evaluated: duration of the disease, presence of osteoporosis, orthopaedic‐neurological comorbidity, trauma, type of work, obligatory postures, use of special shoes/touches. The objective examination will allow the evaluation of the degree of joint impairment, the completion of the WOMAC questionnaire, the pVAS scale (Visual Analogue Scale for pain), knee height from the ground, A diary of the frequency of use of pain control drugs (ibuprofen up to 400mg 2/day), to be completed by the patient or care‐giver, will also be delivered. The concentration of nitrites and nitrates, IL‐1 beta, IL‐6 and TNF‐alpha will be evaluated at the salivary level. Salivary collection will be done by means of Salivets. Dosages of nitrite and nitrate, IL‐6 and TNF‐alpha will be conducted on morning saliva sample. Salivary samples will be processed at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Hygiene Section of the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health ‐ Polytechnic University of Marche, with delivery within the day or refrigerated for a maximum of 4 days before transport from GSS premises to the analysis laboratory.

Change in dietary saturated fat intake is correlated with change in mass of large low-density-lipoprotein particles in men.,"Dreon, DM.; Fernstrom, HA.; Campos, H.; Blanche, PJ.; Williams, PT.; Krauss, RM.","We tested whether nutrient intakes estimated from 4-d diet records were associated with plasma lipoprotein subclasses in 103 men who were randomly assigned to a low-fat (24% fat) and a high-fat (46% fat) diet for 6 wk each in a crossover design. Postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities were also determined in a subset of 43 men. Changes in intake (ie, high fat minus low fat) of total saturated fatty acids, as well as myristic (14:0) and palmitic (16:0) acids, were positively correlated (P < 0.01) with increases in mass of large LDL particles [measured by analytic ultra-centrifugation as mass of lipoproteins of flotation rate (Sf) 7-12] and with LDL peak particle diameter and flotation rate, but not with changes in LDL-cholesterol concentration. Changes in total saturated fatty acids as well as myristic and palmitic acids were also inversely associated with changes in HL activity (P < 0.05). With the high-fat diet only, variation in dietary total saturated fatty acid intake was inversely correlated (P < 0.01) with concentrations of small, dense LDL of Sf 0-5. This correlation was significant specifically for myristic acid (P < 0.001). Stearic acid (18:0), monounsaturates, and polyunsaturates showed no significant associations with lipoprotein concentrations. These data indicate that a high saturated fat intake (especially 14:0 and 16:0) is associated with increased concentrations of larger, cholesterol-enriched LDL and this occurs in association with decreased HL activity.",1998,,The American journal of clinical nutrition,67,,828-836,rayyan-1255197006,10.1093/ajcn/67.5.828,,#14907,Dreon 1998,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
EFECTO DE LA ADICIÓN DE AGUACATE A LA ALIMENTACIÓN HABITUAL SOBRE LOS NIVELES DE LÍPIDOS EN PERSONAS CON DISLIPIDEMIA,"Perilla, Martha Díaz; Toro, Catherine Andrea","The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of the daily  consumption of avocado, a good source of mono-unsaturated fatty acids, on serum lipid levels in dislipidemic subjects. The sample included thirty subjects between 30 and 65 years of age, who are treated by the Andes  Clinic in Tunja. Anthropometry, food frequency and a lipid profile were assessed. Individuals were required to consume 250 g of avocado daily for 4 weeks. Descriptive statistics and a t-test were used. All test  results were considered significant at p&amp;lt; 0.05. Weight gain during the 4-week experimental period for men was 2.7 kg and for women 2.3  (p&amp;lt;0.05). Total cholesterol decreased by 14% (p&amp;lt;0.05) and LDL by 16% (p&amp;lt;0.05); HDL levels increased by 19% (p&amp;lt;0.05) and   triglycerides by 12% (p= 0.037). Normal values of total cholesterol were reached by 27% of the subjects, and of LDL by 30%; HDL levels increased in 91% of the subjects and triglycerides in 20%. Risk for coronary heart disease (CT/ HDL) decreased by 29%. Four subjects have a higher than 20% risk for coronary heart disease in 10 years accordingly to their Framinghann scores. This study shows that   avocado, as a source of mono-unsaturated fatty acids, can be included in the diet plan of dislipidemic patients, as part of the total caloric value to avoid weight gain. In conclusion, for these subjects, consumption of avocado could be a factor that might decrease total cholesterol and LDL and increase HDL, important aspects to prevent coronary heart diseases.",2004,10-Jul,Universitas Scientiarum,9,2,49-58,,,,#15777,Perilla 2004,Exclusion reason: Wrong study type; ,
" Adherence, Body Weight and Quality of Life With Daily Avocado Consumption Among Latina Women of the Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial (HAT)"," Luong, T;  Lichtenstein, A;  Petersen, K;  Kris-Etherton, P;  Sabate, J;  Reboussin, D;  Li, Z"," Objectives: The primary objective was to examine the feasibility and adherence with daily avocado consumption among Latina female participants in HAT. Secondary objectives were to assess changes in weight, waist circumference, and quality of life measures associated with avocado consumption. Methods: HAT was a randomized controlled trial conducted between June 2018 and March 2020 that included 1008 participants of at least 25 years of age and with abdominal obesity. Participants in the intervention arm were asked to consume one avocado per day (approx. 2 servings) for 6 months, whereas participants in the control arm were asked to follow their usual diet and lifestyle and to limit their avocado intake to <2 avocados per month. This analysis consisted of the subset of women who self‐identified as Hispanic or Latina. Women who were pregnant, lactating, or trying to get pregnantwere excluded. Adherence with avocado consumption was assessed using 3 random 24‐hour dietary recalls by research dietitians. Quality of life was assessed by a short form‐36 questionnaire. Results: Within HAT, 158 participants were female that selfidentified as Hispanic/Latina. The median agewas 42 years (IQR: 36, 54) and 92% had overweight/obesity. Across the random dietary recalls, the intervention group (n=80) consumed between 1.9–2.1 avocados, whereas the control group (n=78) consumed between 0.04–0.09 servings of avocados/day. At the end of 6 months, participants in the intervention group had a mean weight change of +0.6 (SD=0.4) kg, versus +0.3 (0.4) kg in the control group; the difference was not significant (p=0.60). Waist circumference did not change in both groups. Quality of life measures were also similar for both groups. Conclusions: Among Hispanic/Latina women, participants in the intervention arm remained adherent with daily avocado consumption for the 6‐month study period without a significant change in quality of life and body weight/waist circumference. Further analyses of lab data (e.g., lipid panel) will determine whether daily avocado consumption confers health benefits for this population.

 The Effect of Including One Avocado Daily in a Habitual Diet on Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load in Free-Living Adults With Overweight/Obesity," LeBeau, K;  Gilhooly, C;  Kris-Etherton, P;  Li, Z;  Lichtenstein, A;  Matthan, N;  Petersen, K;  Reboussin, D;  Adams, M;  Clarke, A;  et al."," Objectives: Lowering the glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) of a diet may reduce cardiometabolic risk. We determined if the daily inclusion of one large avocado in the habitual diet for six months affected the GI and/or GL values of the diet in individuals with overweight/obesity compared to the habitual diet without avocado. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from the Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial, a multi‐site, free‐living, randomized, parallelarm intervention study in which participants (N=1008) were randomized to either eating one avocado/day (AVO group; provided to participants) or abstaining from avocado intake (HD group) for 6 months. Both groups otherwise followed their habitual diet. Dietary data were obtained using three unannounced 24‐hour dietary recalls from which GL and GI values of the diets were estimated. Differences between diet groupswere assessed using linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and energy intake and reported as estimated marginal means (EMM) ± SEM. Those with improbable GL values (< or > three SD from the mean) were excluded from the analysis (n=13). Differences by study site were assessed. Results: Participants with complete dietary data (n=976) were analyzed (women: 73%; mean age 50.5 y [range 25.1–86.6 y], mean [± SD] for BMI in kg/m2: 33.0 [± 5.4]). The unadjusted means (± SD) for GL (glucose reference) values were 107 (± 43) for HD group, and 104 (± 41) for AVO group, and for GL (bread reference) were 153 (± 61) for HD group and 149 (± 59) for AVO group. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and energy intake, the GL values for the AVO group were 13 units lower than HD group (HD: 112 ± 1, AVO: 99 ± 1) using glucose reference, and 19 units lower (HD: 160 ± 2, AVO 141 ± 2) using bread reference (p<0.001). These differences were consistent across study sites. GI of the diet did not vary between the two groups before or after adjustment.

Avocados are rich in beneficial fats, vitamins, minerals, & fiber. To test the hypothesis that avocado consumption will improve glucose control and cardio‐metabolic health in HL adults with or at‐risk of T2D, we recruited 59 HL adults (45 women) who were randomized to an Active (A) group ‐ receiving free avocado vouchers for 12 weeks, or a Control (C) group ‐ no avocado vouchers. Subjects (53 T2D, 4 at risk, 2 unknown) had clinical measurements, blood draws, and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) at Baseline (BL) and Conclusion (CL). Daily avocado consumption logs were kept. At BL, A and C groups did not differ in avocado consumption/day (0.8±0.6 vs 0.5±0.3, respectively). At CL, A group consumption was significantly greater (1.4±0.4 vs 0.4±0.3), p<0.001. Results are shown below. No significant differences between groups were found for time in range (TIR) 70‐140 or 70‐180 mg/dL or time above (TAR) 180 mg/dL.

 Effect of Daily Incorporation of One Avocado on Diet Quality Assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2015: a Randomized Trial," Petersen, K;  Smith, S;  Lichtenstein, A;  Matthan, N;  Li, Z;  Sabate, J;  Rajaram, S;  Segovia-Siapco, G;  Reboussin, D;  Kris-Etherton, P"," Objectives: Few clinical trials have evaluated diet quality change as a predictor of intervention effectiveness. We examined changes in the Healthy Eating Index‐2015 (HEI) in response to a single food‐based intervention. The association between HEI change and intervention effects on cardiometabolic risk‐related trial outcomes was also assessed. Methods: The Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled parallel‐arm study that included 1008 participants aged ≥25 years with elevated waist circumference (women ≥35 inches; men ≥40 inches). The Avocado Supplemented Diet (AVO) group was given and asked to consume one avocado per day, and the Habitual Diet (HD) Group continued their usual diet. Dietary intake was assessed by 24‐hour recalls at baseline and 8, 16, and 26 weeks. Results: At baseline, the HEI score was suboptimal for both groups (AVO: 53.3±15.1 points; HD: 54.0±14.5 points). At 26 weeks, the HEI score was 4.7 points (95% CI 2.9, 6.5) higher in the AVO group compared to the HD Group. The AVO Group had higher scores, compared to the HD group, for the following HEI components: Total Vegetables (mean difference 0.99 points; 95% CI 0.77, 1.21), Fatty Acid Ratio (2.25 points; 95% CI 1.74, 2.77), Sodium (1.03 points; 95% CI 0.52, 1.55), Refined Grains (0.82 points; 95% CI 0.32, 1.31), and Added Sugars (0.84 points; 95% CI 0.49, 1.19). Subgroup analyses showed no difference in HEI improvement by race, ethnicity, BMI category, age group and study site. The HEI effect differed by sex (p=0.002). In the AVO vs. the HD group, HEI was increased in women (6.5 points; 95% CI 4.39, 8.62), but not men (0.02 points; 95% CI −3.44, 3.48). Median HEI change was not associated with intervention effects for the primary outcome (visceral adipose tissue volume), secondary outcomes (hepatic fat fraction, hsCRP and metabolic syndrome criteria), or additional outcomes (lipids/lipoproteins, insulin, weight). Conclusions: Intake of one avocado per day as part of usual intake for 6 months in free‐living individuals with elevated waist circumference modestly increased diet quality. Small improvements in diet quality over a long period of time may result in improved long‐term cardiometabolic outcomes.

 EFFECTS OF AN AVOCADO BASED MEDITERRANEAN DIET ON SERUM LIPIDS FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION AFTER ISCHEMIC STROKE TRIAL (ADD-SPISE)," Olavarria, V;  Campodonico, P;  Lavados, P"," Background and Aims: Dietary risk has a high impact in DALYs in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Adherence to dietary patterns like the Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) are associated with a decreased risk of stroke mortality/incidence in observational studies and primary prevention trials. Furthermore, lowering Low Density Cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels decreases stroke recurrence. Interestingly, Avocado‐substituted diets have also been shown to decrease cholesterol levels. Aim: To investigate the effect of a MeDi based on Avocados on lipid profile after an AIS. Methods: Academic, open‐label, blinded outcome assessment, controlled clinical trial. Recruitment within a month of AIS if fulfilling eligibility criteria (including consent) and randomly assigned to: A) Avocado based MeDi with daily intake of 1/2 an avocado B) Low fat‐high complex carbohydrate healthy‐diet in a 1:1 ratio. The main efficacy outcome is a reduction in plasma LDL‐C levels at 3 months of the dietary intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes in the levels of serum lipid profile and serum inflammation markers, safety, and feasibility. A sample size of 200 patients was estimated to provide 80% power and 5% level of significance (10% loss and 5% crossover) to detect a minimum difference of 4.6 mg/dL in LDL‐C after 3 months of intervention. The study has ethics committee approval. Results: The trial was completed. From August 2018 to October 2022, 200 patients were recruited and 189 completed 3‐month follow‐up.

 Food-specific Compounds Act as Putative Biomarkers for Exposure to and Effect of Plant Foods Consumed within a Mediterranean Diet Intervention," Hill, E;  Rasolofomanana-Rajery, S;  Khajeh-Sharafabadi, M;  Weaver, N;  Reisdorph, R;  Quinn, K;  Michel, C;  Doenges, K;  Sutliff, A;  Borengasser, S;  et al."," Objectives: Biomarkers of dietary intake will help define exposure to and effect of recommended foods and food groups consumed within high‐quality dietary patterns such as a Mediterranean diet (MED). The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify food‐specific compounds (FSC) present in plant foods that were increased in plasma after consumption of MED and (2) evaluate associations between change in plant FSC and change in cardiovascular (CV) health indicators. Methods: Individuals (n=41) completed a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study of a MED intervention rich in plant foods from multiple food groups (e.g., fruits, vegetables, herbs, legumes, nuts). Fasting plasma was collected and CV health indicators (e.g., lipid profile) assessed pre‐ and postintervention. Samples of plasma and 100 foods from the MED trial were analyzed in triplicate via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Compounds were considered FSC if detected in all replicates of a food but none of the other 99 foods. For plant FSC also detected in plasma, linear mixed effects models were used to assess change over intervention and association between this change and change in CV health indicators. Statistical significance was assessed using false discovery rate (FDR)< 0.05 and nominal significance p<0.05. Results: Foods with the greatest number of FSC significantly increasing in plasma after MED for each plant food group were avocado (7), cherry (5), basil (4), red bell pepper (3), chickpea (2), and walnut (1). Several FSC were associated with change in CV health indicators. For example, 1 cherry FSC that increased over intervention was significantly associated with reduction in total cholesterol, and 2 cherry FSC that increased were nominally associated with reduction in LDL cholesterol and Apolipo protein B. Similarly, 1 red bell pepper FSC that increased over intervention was nominally associated with reduction in total cholesterol. Conclusions: FSC from plant foods consumed within MED are detectable in plasma, increase after consumption, and are associated with improvements in CV health indicators. These plant foods were selected for further testing in a semi‐controlled feeding study to evaluate FSCs as putative biomarkers of intake and effect in a prospective clinical trial (NCT05500976).

" mini-MED: study protocol for a randomized, multi-intervention, semi-controlled feeding trial of a Mediterranean-amplified vs. habitual Western dietary pattern for the evaluation of food-specific compounds and cardiometabolic health"," Hill, EB;  Tang, M;  Long, JM;  Kemp, JF;  Westcott, JL;  Hendricks, AE;  Reisdorph, NA;  Campbell, WW;  Krebs, NF"," Background: Diet is among the most influential lifestyle factors impacting chronic disease risk. Nutrimetabolomics, the application of metabolomics to nutrition research, allows for the detection of food‐specific compounds (FSCs) that can be used to connect dietary patterns, such as a Mediterranean‐style (MED) diet, to health. This validation study is based upon analyses from a controlled feeding MED intervention, where our team identified FSCs from eight foods that can be detected in biospecimens after consumption and may therefore serve as food intake biomarkers. Methods: Individuals with overweight/obesity who do not habitually consume a MED dietary pattern will complete a 16‐week randomized, multi‐intervention, semi‐controlled feeding study of isocaloric dietary interventions: (1) MED‐amplified dietary pattern, containing 500 kcal/day from eight MED target foods: avocado, basil, cherry, chickpea, oat, red bell pepper, walnut, and a protein source (alternating between salmon or unprocessed, lean beef), and (2) habitual/Western dietary pattern, containing 500 kcal/day from six non‐MED target foods: cheesecake, chocolate frozen yogurt, refined grain bread, sour cream, white potato, and unprocessed, lean beef. After a 2‐week washout, participants complete four, 4‐week intervention periods, with biospecimen sampling and outcome assessments at baseline and at intervention weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. The primary outcome is change in the relative abundance of FSCs from the eight MED target foods in participant biospecimens from baseline to the end of each intervention period. Secondary outcomes include mean change in cardiometabolic health indicators, inflammatory markers, and adipokines. Exploratory outcomes include change in diversity and community composition of the gut microbiota. Discussion: Our stepwise strategy, beginning with identification of FSCs in whole diets and biospecimens, followed by relating these to health indicators will lead to improved methodology for assessment of dietary patterns and a better understanding of the relationship between food and health. This study will serve as a first step toward validating candidate food intake biomarkers and allow for assessment of relationships with cardiometabolic health. The identification of food intake biomarkers is critical to future research and has implications spanning health promotion and disease prevention for many chronic conditions.

 Measuring diet by metabolomics: a 14-d controlled feeding study of weighed food intake," Playdon, MC;  Tinker, LF;  Prentice, RL;  Loftfield, E;  Hayden, KM;  Van Horn, L;  Sampson, JN;  Stolzenberg-Solomon, R;  Lampe, JW;  Neuhouser, ML;  et al."," BACKGROUND: Metabolomics has the potential to enhance dietary assessment by revealing objective measures of many aspects of human food intake. Although metabolomics studies indicate that hundreds of metabolites are associated with dietary intake, correlations have been modest (e.g., r < 0.50), and few have been evaluated in controlled feeding studies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between metabolites and weighed food and beverage intake in a controlled feeding study of habitual diet. METHODS: Healthy postmenopausal females from the Women's Health Initiative (N = 153) were provided with a customized 2‐wk controlled diet designed to emulate their usual diet. Metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in end‐of‐study 24‐h urine and fasting serum samples (1293 urine metabolites; 1113 serum metabolites). We calculated partial Pearson correlations between these metabolites and intake of 65 food groups, beverages, and supplements during the feeding study. The threshold for significance was Bonferroni‐adjusted to account for multiple testing (5.94 × 10‐07 for urine metabolites; 6.91 × 10‐07 for serum metabolites). RESULTS: Significant diet‐metabolite correlations were identified for 23 distinct foods, beverages, and supplements (171 distinct metabolites). Among foods, strong metabolite correlations (r ≥ 0.60) were evident for citrus (highest r = 0.80), dairy (r = 0.65), and broccoli (r = 0.63). Among beverages and supplements, strong correlations were evident for coffee (r = 0.86), alcohol (r = 0.69), multivitamins (r = 0.69), and vitamin E supplements (r = 0.65). Moderate correlations (r = 0.50‐0.60) were also observed for avocado, fish, garlic, grains, onion, poultry, and black tea. Correlations were specific; each metabolite correlated with one food, beverage, or supplement, except for metabolites correlated with juice or multivitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolite levels had moderate to strong correlations with weighed intake of habitually consumed foods, beverages, and supplements. These findings exceed in magnitude those previously observed in population studies and exemplify the strong potential of metabolomics to contribute to nutrition research.

"Fecal Metagenomics to Identify Biomarkers of Food Intake in Healthy Adults: Findings from Randomized, Controlled, Nutrition Trials.",Shinn LM; Mansharamani A; Baer DJ; Novotny JA; Charron CS; Khan NA; Zhu R; Holscher HD,"BACKGROUND: Undigested components of the human diet affect the composition and function of the microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract. Techniques like metagenomic analyses allow researchers to study functional capacity, thus revealing the potential of using metagenomic data for developing objective biomarkers of food intake. OBJECTIVES: As a continuation of our previous work using 16S and metabolomic datasets, we aimed to utilize a computationally intensive, multivariate, machine-learning approach to identify fecal KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) Orthology (KO) categories as biomarkers that accurately classify food intake. METHODS: Data were aggregated from 5 controlled feeding studies that studied the individual impact of almonds, avocados, broccoli, walnuts, barley, and oats on the adult gastrointestinal microbiota. Deoxyribonucleic acid from preintervention and postintervention fecal samples underwent shotgun genomic sequencing. After preprocessing, sequences were aligned and functionally annotated with Double Index AlignMent Of Next-generation sequencing Data v2.0.11.149 and MEtaGenome ANalyzer v6.12.2, respectively. After the count normalization, the log of the fold change ratio for resulting KOs between pre- and postintervention of the treatment group against its corresponding control was utilized to conduct differential abundance analysis. Differentially abundant KOs were used to train machine-learning models examining potential biomarkers in both single-food and multi-food models. RESULTS: We identified differentially abundant KOs in the almond (n = 54), broccoli (n = 2474), and walnut (n = 732) groups (q < 0.20), which demonstrated classification accuracies of 80%, 87%, and 86% for the almond, broccoli, and walnut groups using a random forest model to classify food intake into each food group's respective treatment and control arms, respectively. The mixed-food random forest achieved 81% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal promise in utilizing fecal metagenomics to objectively complement self-reported measures of food intake. Future research on various foods and dietary patterns will expand these exploratory analyses for eventual use in feeding study compliance and clinical settings.",2024,Jan,J Nutr,154,1,271-283,,10.1016/j.tjnut.2023.11.001,37949114,#15833,Shinn 2024,Exclusion reason: Wrong article type; ,

Food intolerance related to gastrointestinal symptoms amongst adults living with bile acid diarrhoea: A cross-sectional study,"McKenzie, YA; French, C; Todd, C; Burden, S","BackgroundThe role of food in managing bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) is poorly understood. The present study explored the prevalence of food intolerance amongst adults with BAD.MethodsThe study comprised a cross-sectional survey of adults with BAD determined by the 75selenium homotaurocholic acid test (SeHCAT) living in the UK. Participants anonymously completed an online questionnaire on 39 food items. Frequency of food in general affecting BAD symptoms, as well as frequencies of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and consequential food avoidance after food item ingestion, were assessed. Food group avoidance was also assessed.ResultsThere were 434 participants who completed the questionnaire between April and May 2021 of whom 80% reported moderate to severe chronic diarrhoea. Food intolerances were reported by 88.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 84.6-90.9) of participants. Diarrhoea was reported most frequently after take-away food, fish and chips, creamy sauces, cream and large quantities of fruit (range 41.0%-33.6%). Lowest frequencies were for potato, avocado, mango, watermelon and pear (range 3.7%-7.4%) for the foods listed in the questionnaire. Similar trends were found for abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and consequential food avoidance. Symptom-triggering within 30 min of ingestion was more prevalence than after 30 min for almost all foods. Food group avoidance was highest for fatty foods (81.2%; 95% CI = 77.8-85.3) followed by dairy (53.9%; 95% CI = 49.1-58.7).ConclusionsPerceived food intolerance amongst adults with BAD and persisting diarrhoeal symptoms is high. Important triggers were meals with a higher fat content and higher-fat dairy products. Diets amongst those with persisting diarrhoeal symptoms may be overly restrictive.Bile acid diarrhoea is a common, underappreciated disorder, with an unmet need to improve treatment. The present study explored the prevalence of food intolerance amongst adults with BAD. Important triggers were meals with a higher fat content and higher-fat dairy products. Diets amongst those with persisting diarrhoeal symptoms may be overly restrictive.imageThis cross-sectional online study identified a very high prevalence of perceived food intolerance amongst 434 UK adults living with self-reported 75selenium homotaurocholic acid test (SeHCAT)-diagnosed bile acid diarrhoea.Out of 39 foods explored, take-aways and fish and chips were most frequently blamed for provoking overall gut symptoms and diarrhoea.Potato, avocado, mango, watermelon and pear were perceived to be the least frequently provocative for onset of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence.These findings indicate that further studies are needed to better understand the tolerance to dietary fat in bile acid diarrhoea, supporting the inclusion of lower-fat milk and dairy products, fruits and vegetables.",2024,,JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS,37,1,79-93,WOS:001068072900001,10.1111/jhn.13232,,#15924,McKenzie 2024,Exclusion reason: Intake unspecified; ,
Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effect on Multivariate Responses Using Random Forests,"Guo, B.; Holscher, H.D.; Auvil, L.S.; Welge, M.E.; Bushell, C.B.; Novotny, J.A.; Baer, D.J.; Burd, N.A.; Khan, N.A.; Zhu, R.","Estimating the individualized treatment effect has become one of the most popular topics in statistics and machine learning communities in recent years. Most existing methods focus on modeling the heterogeneous treatment effects for univariate outcomes. However, many biomedical studies are interested in studying multiple highly correlated endpoints at the same time. We propose a random forest model that simultaneously estimates individualized treatment effects of multivariate outcomes. We consider a popular study design where covariates and outcomes are measured both before and after the intervention. The proposed model uses oblique splitting rules to partition population space to the neighborhood that experiences distinct treatment effects. An extensive simulation study suggests that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in various nonlinear settings. We further apply the proposed method to two nutrition studies investigating the effects of food consumption on gastrointestinal microbiota composition and clinical biomarkers.

Analysis and evaluation on decrease of anticoagulant effect of warfarin by herbal and dietary supplements based on case report literature ,"Lijun, W.; Bing, C.; Peng, Z.; Yuyong, J.; Haodong, C.","Objective To analyze and evaluate the decrease of anticoagulant effect of warfarin by herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) based on case report literature. Methods The case reports on decrease of anticoagulant effect of warfarin by HDS were selected by searching the relevant databases at home and abroad (up to June 24, 2023). The degree of decrease of anticoagulant effect of warfarin by HDS was evaluated according to the reduction degree of international normalized ratio and the occurrence of thrombotic events in patients in the case reports. The reliability scoring criteria of HDS⁃warfarin interaction was established according to the causality of the interaction between HDS and warfarin, the number of case reports, and the other evidences (warnings issued by relevant national institutions, clinical studies, pharma⁃ cokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies, animal studies, etc.). It was evaluated as highly, relatively, possibly, and suspiciously reliable if the total score was ≥9, 6⁃8, 3⁃5, and ≤2 points, respectively. Results A total of 17 case reports were enrolled in the analysis, involving 25 patients and 11 kinds of HDS. Two kinds of HDS reduced the anticoagulant effect of warfarin severely, including ginseng (Radix Ginseng)[(American ginseng (Radix Panacis Quinquefolii), red ginseng, etc.] and Myrrh; 5 kinds of HDS reduced the anticoagu⁃ lant effect of warfarin moderately, including St. John′s wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), tea [green tea (Camellia sinensis), black tea], peppermint (Herba Menthae), coenzyme Q10, and chitosan; 4 kinds of HDS reduced the anticoagulant effect of warfarin slightly, including milkvetch root (Radix Astragali seu Hedysari), avocado, seaweed (Sargassum), and soya (Glycine max). The reliability of anticoagulant effect reduction of warfarin was evaluated as highly reliable in 1 kind of HDS, namely St. John′s wort (10 points), relatively reliable in 2 kinds of HDS, including ginseng and tea (8 and 6 points, respectively), possibly reliable in 7 kinds of HDS, including Myrrh, peppermint, coenzyme Q10, chitosan, milkvetch root, avocado, and seaweed (5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, and 3 points, respectively), and suspiciously reliable in 1 kind of HDS, namely soya (2 points). Conclusion The degree and reliability of anticoagulant effect reduction of warfarin by ginseng (American ginseng, red ginseng, etc.), St. John′s wort, and tea(green tea, black tea), are higher, which should be paid attention to by clinicians and clinical pharmacists. © 2023 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

Community pharmacy is the key to improving vitamin D levels,"Lopez-Carmona, F.; Toro-Ruiz, A.; Gomez-Guzman, M.; Valverde-Merino, M.I.; Piquer-Martinez, C.; Zarzuelo, M.J.","Introduction: Vitamin D is an essential micronutrient that participates in the body's fundamental physiological processes. The pharmacist should involve the patient in his medication adherence, leading to a change in the patient's attitude towards his medication and towards his health problem, in order to achieve the pharmacological objective set. Methods: Quasi-experimental multicenter study design with non-probabilistic convenience sampling. A pharmacist-led intervention in health education was carried out, divided in two groups, face-to-face interview and on-line survey, and the results were evaluated 3 months later to observe if there was any change in the patient's health status or in their vitamin D levels. Results: The study was conducted in four pharmacies through face-to-face interviews (n = 49 patients) and online surveys (n = 23). Pharmaceutical intervention improved habits of exercise (0.81 ± 1.44 days/week face-to-face interviews vs −0.09 ± 2.35 days/week online surveys (p = 0.048)). In face-to-face interviews, consumption of vitamin D-rich foods was increased (0.55 unit of tuna/week; p = 0.035 and 0.56 unit of avocado/week; p = 0.001) and was improved correct intake of vitamin D supplements (32.5% baseline to 69.8% at 3 months). The increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (11.5 ng/mL after 3 months (p = 0.021)) was correlated to salmon consumption (0.951; p = 0.013) and the improvement of quality of life was correlated to avocado consumption (1; p < 0.001). Conclusion: There are habits that improve vitamin D production such as increased physical activity, the correct use of vitamin D supplements and the consumption of foods with high vitamin D levels. The role of the pharmacist is crucial, involving the patient in the treatment making aware of the benefits for his/her health status of increasing vitamin D levels. © 2023 The Authors",2023,,Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy,9,,,,10.1016/j.rcsop.2023.100224,,#16045,Lopez-Carmona 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong outcomes; ,
Effects of the low-carb organic Mediterranean diet on testosterone levels and sperm DNA fragmentation,"Corsetti, V.; Notari, T.; Montano, L.","The causes of male infertility can vary. Lifestyles, environmental factors, stressful conditions, and socio-economic conditions are significant factors. Diet plays a crucial role in improving a man's reproductive capacity. The appropriate diet should be diverse and ensure the intake of all the necessary nutrients to enhance sperm quality. The Mediterranean diet, which includes high amounts of vegetables and fruits rich in detoxifying and antioxidant substances, as well as polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, and microelements, especially when consumed with organic foods and a lower carbohydrate regimen, are the key aspects addressed in this study. The objective of this research was to modify the diets of 50 subfertile men by providing them with a specific nutritional plan. This plan included consuming 80% organic foods, introducing whole grains and low glycemic load options, eliminating refined carbohydrates, consuming green leafy vegetables and red fruits daily, reducing or eliminating dairy products, consuming primarily grass-fed meat and wild caught seafood, eliminating saturated fats in favor of healthy fats like olive oil, avocado, and nuts. After three months of adhering to the low-carb food plan, testosterone levels significantly increased, while sperm DNA fragmentation decreased in a subgroup of individuals who reduced their carbohydrate intake by 35%. © 2023",2023,,Current Research in Food Science,7,,,,10.1016/j.crfs.2023.100636,,#16053,Corsetti 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong intervention/exposure; ,
